We have tried to make sure that these particulars are accurate, but to a large extent we have to rely on what the seller tells us about the property. We do not check every single piece of information ourselves as the cost of doing so would be prohibitive and we do not wish to unnecessarily add to the cost of moving house. In accordance with the misrepresentation act, we are required to inform both potential vendors and purchasers, that from time to time both vendors and or purchasers, may be known by our staff, by way of previous customers, friends, neighbours, relatives, etc. Once you find the property you want to buy, you will need to carry out more investigations into the property than it is practical or reasonable for an estate agent to do when preparing sales particulars. For example, we have not carried out any kind of survey of the property to look for structural defects and would advise any homebuyer to obtain a surveyor's report before exchanging contracts. If you do not have your own surveyor, we would be pleased to recommend one. We have not checked whether any equipment in the property (such as central heating) is in working order and would advise homebuyers to check this. You should also instruct a solicitor to investigate all legal matters relating to the property (e.g. Title, planning permission etc., ), as these are specialist matters in which estate agents are not qualified. Your solicitor will also agree with the seller what items (e.g. Carpets, curtains etc., ) will be included in the sale.See full description"

Bordered by West Green, Langley Green, Three Bridges and Southgate, the town centre is also included in the Northgate neighbourhood, including the main shopping areas of Queens Square and County Mall.

Nestled in the midst of 1.15 of an acre edged with tall trees providing privacy and security and surrounded by farmland.The house has recently been refurbished, the entrance hall leads to the light and bright dining room with exposed beams and fitted shelving. There is a stunning triple aspect lounge with beams, solid wood floor, a superb brick fireplace with an open fire and a cedar mantle believed to have come from the original cedar house that was previously on the site.

There is a summerhouse at the bottom of the garden and offers the potential to create separate accommodation as an annex, subject to the necessary planning permissions.What the Owner says:We spent a lot of time searching for the perfect property and immediately fell in love with the house as soon as we saw it. Being surrounded by fields and open countryside the views are delightful and have hardly changed in all the time we have been here. While the garden is so quiet and peaceful as well as being very private, this greatly appeals to my youngest grandson who says it is so relaxing as he and his brothers can play without disturbing anyone. I will miss the sunrises and sunsets from the balcony and the terrace and just being able to enjoy the local wildlife. At the same time we can be in the City or West End within an hour door to door taking the Central Line from Theydon Bois so makes it an excellent home for London commuters.Abridge is a quaint village on the River Roding and includes some lovely period houses as well as pubs and restaurants, a useful convenience store and petrol station, a village hall, cricket club and the Abridge golf and country club as well as the primary school along Hoe Lane. While nearby Theydon Bois not only has the underground station but also an iconic avenue of trees and virtually no streetlights as the residents felt they would detract from the traditional village ambience. There are lovely areas to go for walks in Epping Forest and other country parks and we are also not far from the M11 for access to the M25, Stansted and Cambridge.Room sizes:Entrance HallCloakroomSitting Room 19'2 x 18'8 (5.85m x 5.69m)Drawing Room 22'6 x 16'8 (6.86m x 5.08m)Dining Room 20'9 x 10'8 (6.33m x 3.25m)StudyKitchen 25'9 x 25'8 (7.85m x 7.83m)Utility Room 6'3 x 2'7 (1.91m x 0.79m)Shower RoomLandingBedroom 1 19'2 x 17'5 (5.85m x 5.31m)En-Suite BathroomEn-Suite Dressing Room 18'6 x 11'6 (5.64m x 3.51m)BalconyBedroom 2 19'4 x 15'7 (5.90m x 4.75m)En-Suite Bathroom RoomBedroom 3 17'6 x 10'8 (5.34m x 3.25m)En-Suite Shower RoomBedroom 4 16'0 x 11'4 (4.88m x 3.46m)En-Suite Shower RoomGarageOff Street ParkingRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

It is just one of five houses in the charming enclave of Bassetts Fields which backs onto Blakes Golf Course and is surrounded by countryside. At the same time it is only a short drive to Epping underground station where the Central Line trains can whisk you to Liverpool Street in approximately 40 minutes, so is ideal for commuters. While, from an educational point of view, there are excellent state and independent schools and colleges within the vicinity.The house includes a very large, block paved driveway where you can park numerous vehicles. It leads to a large detached pitched room double garage that could always be converted into separate accommodation, subject to the appropriate permissions being obtained, as well as to the front door. The good sized entrance hall provides access to all the rooms on the ground floor including the family room that is ideal for anyone looking to work from home as it is just inside the front door overlooking the drive, so it means business visitors do not need to venture into the private areas in the home.There is a cloakroom and a well-proportioned dining room with a large storage cupboard for those more formal occasions and family celebrations as well as a very spacious and impressive light and bright dual aspect sitting room approached through double doors. It has solid wood flooring, a charming stone surround fireplace as a focal point and French doors to the rear terrace. The kitchen/breakfast room includes a range cooker and wood units with granite worktops housing a double oven and gas hob as well as an integrated fridge freezer and dishwasher but still leaves plenty of space for a table and chairs. There is an adjacent utility room with laundry facilities and a door to the garden.Off the spacious landing on the first floor there is a store cupboard, a bathroom and five double bedrooms including one with and en-suite shower and a larger one with fitted cupboards and a large en-suite shower room and stunning views across the golf course and the countryside beyond. The very easy to manage rear garden includes a vast terrace that spans the width of the property and is just the place to enjoy outdoor entertaining while revelling in the far reaching views as well as a large lawn that is ideal for kids to kick a ball around and play with the dog.What the Owner says:We bought this house from new over 22 years ago and it has been a wonderful family home, but there is also great potential for new owners to develop it even further and really make it their own. We really love the area and have moved to somewhere smaller in the same vicinity now the family have grown up so the house is immediately available with no onward chain. As well as the fabulous location we were also attracted to the variety of schools available including the local primary school. North Weald Bassett is a charming village in the Epping Forest district and is famous for its weekly market held on the North Weald Airfield and the Blakes Golf Club.As well as the Central Line station at Epping we are also close to the M11 motorway, providing access to the M25 so travelling to all parts of the country is simple. Epping includes delightful period properties lining the High Street in a Conservation Area, such as the council office with its clock tower and the Gothic Revival water tower. It has a Monday market that has been in existence since the 13th century and has more than 80 different stalls.

We have tried to make sure that these particulars are accurate, but to a large extent we have to rely on what the seller tells us about the property. We do not check every single piece of information ourselves as the cost of doing so would be prohibitive and we do not wish to unnecessarily add to the cost of moving house. In accordance with the misrepresentation act, we are required to inform both potential vendors and purchasers, that from time to time both vendors and or purchasers, may be known by our staff, by way of previous customers, friends, neighbours, relatives, etc. Once you find the property you want to buy, you will need to carry out more investigations into the property than it is practical or reasonable for an estate agent to do when preparing sales particulars. For example, we have not carried out any kind of survey of the property to look for structural defects and would advise any homebuyer to obtain a surveyor's report before exchanging contracts. If you do not have your own surveyor, we would be pleased to recommend one. We have not checked whether any equipment in the property (such as central heating) is in working order and would advise homebuyers to check this. You should also instruct a solicitor to investigate all legal matters relating to the property (e.g. Title, planning permission etc., ), as these are specialist matters in which estate agents are not qualified. Your solicitor will also agree with the seller what items (e.g. Carpets, curtains etc., ) will be included in the sale.See full description"

The house is well situated with easy access to the M4, Reading is just a short journey along the A33, retail parks, a great University and more. Not to forget the convenience of several parks, shops, post office within a 5/10 minute walk. Lots of lovely country walks on our doorstep, many protected as part of the planning requirements for the estate. There are good transport links with a bus stop a few minutes away, and access to London by train on two different lines from either Reading or Wokingham.The downstairs area is very spacious light and airy with our bay window. To the rear we have patio doors leading into the garden to which we have added a great patio area, mowing edges for the lawn and some easy maintenance planting. It’s usually full of wagtails, bees and butterflies - lovely! It’s a very private space and barely overlooked, fully fenced and thus ideal for kids and pets alike. It’s a great place to entertain.It’s a very peaceful and quiet place to live. The neighbours are all lovely.The house is very efficient, there are two thermostats, one upstairs and one downstairs so you don't have to heat the whole house if you don't need to. And there is always enough hot water - on demand- for all 3 showers to operate at the same time if needed.We have loved living here and will find it incredibly sad leaving this beautiful home but our work takes us elsewhere.The Agents View...This is the first time we have seen this design on Shinfield Meadows and it was worth the wait! You have great space downstairs, a large bay fronted lounge to the front, then a utility cupboard and downstairs cloakroom. Across the back, you have the superb kitchen breakfast room, with plenty of space to make another family room, which leads to the private garden. It doesn't stop there, as on the next floor you have three great bedrooms, an en suite and a four-piece suite family bathroom! The top floor offers another bedroom, this one with built-in wardrobes and a fantastic en suite. All of this as well as a garage and a private driveway, what's not to like!The Area View...Piggott Road is nice and tucked away at the start of Shinfield Meadows. Shinfield Meadows itself is a lovely location, very central to all your needs and wants. Literally, just a few minutes walk you will find the popular Langley Mead nature reserve, which is great for walks and you also have various play parks close by. Within a short walk or drive you have plenty of amenities including Dobbies Garden Centre which now has a Waitrose Local, along with a great butcher and within Shinfield Village, you have Co-Op a few popular pubs, a post office and soon to have a very popular cafè which we can't wait for.There is a main bus route running through the estate itself taking you into Reading town and you are just a few minutes from Mereoak Park and Ride or junction 11 of the M4.See full description"

The building was built between 1921 and 1924 to a design by Sir Edwin Cooper, based on a plan produced by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott in 1915, to provide accommodation and nursing facilities for seriously injured servicemen. It was converted in 2014 into exclusive luxury apartments by the 'high end' developers London Square.As soon as you enter the apartment there is an immediate sense of elegance and grace, with a most welcoming and impressive entrance. The room proportions throughout are simply exquisite and further emphasised by the incredibly generous ceiling heights. There is an excellent flow of natural light, afforded by both the wonderful floor to ceiling doors that lead onto the terraces from all principal rooms and the open aspects that provide such far reaching views. The layout is ideal for large scale entertaining as well as everyday family life with a separate kitchen/dining room and views over Star and Garter Hill. The current owner has interior designed the exceptional reception room which features wall to ceiling arched windows both opening onto the two terraces.The private south west facing terraces measures almost 2750 square feet are a real feature of this apartment. Whilst there are also beautifully manicured communal gardens to enjoy there are very few properties within Star and Garter House that have private outside space on this scale, let alone such a beautiful and generous space that commands what are unquestionably amongst the very best views in the country.

These views are deemed to be so important that they are protected by an act of Parliament and are perhaps most famously captured by Turner's watercolours.The leisure suite, available exclusively to residents, is divided into distinct areas containing the pool and jacuzzi, gym and sun room, with views of the gardens as a glorious backdrop. The 16 x 5 metre pool is fitted with resistance jets, making it suitable for serious swimming, whilst the adjacent Jacuzzi provides the perfect environment for soothing tired muscles. The sun room has heated loungers and the generously sized gym area is equipped with the latest cardio machines.

The Star and Garter gardens were laid out when the building was opened and are undoubtedly one of its greatest assets. Residents can also take advantage of the town car service and 24 hour concierge.LocationThe apartment is superbly situated at the summit of Richmond Hill, on the doorstep of Richmond Park - with its 2300 glorious deer inhabited acres.

Photographs and floor plans show only certain aspects of the property at the time they were taken and it should not be assumed that the property remains exactly as it is shown. There may be a small discrepancy between measurements shown on the floorplan due to Niche metric conversion. Prospective purchasers should make specific enquiries concerning any matters of particular importance affecting a decision to view or purchase the property and are strongly advised to contact the office regarding the availability of the property before undertaking any journeys and incurring any abortive costs.Note : Comyn and James wish to point out that the google map marker and street scene may not show the exact location correctly as it will usually show the centre of the property’s post code. Every effort has been made to try to ensure that the marker is in the correct place wherever possible. Comyn and James would also point out that Google maps are frequently out of date and do not show the true surroundings.

These may include mortgages, conveyancing, general planning advice, surveys and valuations, estate agency services and removals.Our policy is that we do not take referral fees for these introductions –Safeguarding your informationImportant information regarding cybercrime. It has come to our attention that computer hackers are seeking to target property transactions to access funds. As we understand it, they will either hack a phone, tablet or pc, maybe by sending out a random email which mistakenly gets opened, or even whilst opening a website, which gives them access to that machine.The reason for us mentioning this is to you is to alert you that once they have gained access, they can monitor email correspondence, without you knowing, throughout a transaction. Then, at a relevant point, e.g. Just before exchange of contracts, they can send an email to a client mirroring that of their solicitor asking for funds to be transferred to a certain bank account. That money then, of course, disappears.Fortunately, we have not had such an instance but, feel it important to highlight the fact that if you do receive an email requesting funds, it is worth double checking with the person concerned by phone that it is genuine and the bank details are correct, before sending money. This could, of course, affect other areas of finance beyond property. Many solicitors are starting to highlight this point now, but for safety, we would urge you to be vigilant and check before sending money or passing on any personal details regarding any bank or credit card information.See full description"
