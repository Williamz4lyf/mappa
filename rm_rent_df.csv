It has come to our attention that computer hackers are seeking to target property transactions to access funds. As we understand it, they will either hack a phone, tablet, or PC, maybe by sending out a random email that mistakenly gets opened, or even whilst opening a website, which gives them access to that machine. The reason for us mentioning this to you is to alert you that once they have gained access, they can monitor email correspondence, without you knowing, throughout a transaction. Then, at a relevant point, e.g. just before the exchange of contracts, they can send an email to a client mirroring that of their solicitor asking for funds to be transferred to a certain bank account. That money then, of course, disappears. Fortunately, we have not had such an instance but, feel it important to highlight the fact that if you do receive an email requesting funds, it is worth checking with the person concerned by phone that it is genuine and the bank details are correct, before sending money. This could, of course, affect other areas of finance beyond the property. Solicitors are starting to highlight this point now, but for safety, we would urge you to be vigilant and check before sending money or passing on any personal details regarding any bank or credit card information.The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991These particulars are set out as a general outline in accordance with the Property Misdescriptions Act (1991) only for the guidance of intending purchasers or lessees and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract.

It has come to our attention that computer hackers are seeking to target property transactions to access funds. As we understand it, they will either hack a phone, tablet, or PC, maybe by sending out a random email that mistakenly gets opened, or even whilst opening a website, which gives them access to that machine. The reason for us mentioning this to you is to alert you that once they have gained access, they can monitor email correspondence, without you knowing, throughout a transaction. Then, at a relevant point, e.g. just before the exchange of contracts, they can send an email to a client mirroring that of their solicitor asking for funds to be transferred to a certain bank account. That money then, of course, disappears. Fortunately, we have not had such an instance but, feel it important to highlight the fact that if you do receive an email requesting funds, it is worth checking with the person concerned by phone that it is genuine and the bank details are correct, before sending money. This could, of course, affect other areas of finance beyond the property. Solicitors are starting to highlight this point now, but for safety, we would urge you to be vigilant and check before sending money or passing on any personal details regarding any bank or credit card information.The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991These particulars are set out as a general outline in accordance with the Property Misdescriptions Act (1991) only for the guidance of intending purchasers or lessees and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract.

Click the ""Request Details"" button, submit the form and we'll text & email you within minutes, day or night.We're renting our lovely two bedroom flat in Belsize Park where our family, including our two small children, has been living for the past 5 years.  It has a garden with morning and afternoon sun, its own private and very secure side entrance and a very short commute to practically anywhere.

A couple of key features:

Main room - this is a fantastic space for entertaining. Aside from the main area in the flat itself, the French doors open up into the garden and a summer party can then accommodate 60+ people (we've done it).  The ceilings are high and there is a feeling of openness. It's a big space. 

Main bedroom - we have kept our large bed in this room which includes a hotel grade mattress which will make a real difference to your sleep; it has a walk-in wardrobe and another set of full height cupboards for storage, which we found to be plenty (and we have plenty of stuff). There is also a skylight, so there is plenty of light coming into the room, particularly in the morning. 

Small bedroom - we had two small children sleeping in this room and they loved it; their own den.  It has ultra soft carpet so the kids could play on the floor and it's very cosy. Alternatively, this works as a home office. It can be closed off from the rest of the flat, is nice and quiet and has its own bathroom.

Storage - there is a lot of storage for a flat. From the walk-in wardrobe to the full height cupboards in the laundry, side return, kitchen and main room, every available bit of space has been used for storage. You might note the space for a wine fridge in the photos too.

The building - it is a beautiful building to live in and it's a beautiful tree lined street. Our lovely neighbours above, between them, own the rest of the building and it is very well maintained and cared for property. 

The location - for us, the location has been ideal. It's a 2-3 minute, very safe walk to Swiss Cottage tube or a 10 minute walk to Belsize Park or Chalk Farm. Our own commute to Green Park was less than 20 minutes door to door and an Uber back after a night out in Soho is <£14. 

This flat suits a couple who particularly enjoy entertaining, can make the most of central living.  We've enjoyed living here and the lifestyle it brings and we hope you do too.

The FA Cup was played here, Colour TV was invented here, the first pneumatic railway ran through Sydenham and many famous & notorious people have made it their homeIn 1871 Sydenham was imortalised in the works of the exiled Camille Pissaro - the most famous of which, a view along Lawrie Park Avenue towards St Bart's Church, now hangs in the National Gallery.
