Each property has driveway parking, a garage and a garden.The stable yard is made up of the Upper and Lower Yard and contains 25 boxes with appropriate tack and feed storage rooms. There is also a coffee room with a wood burning stove for cold winter days. Previously the stable complex contained planning consent for conversion of part to a 1 bed bedsit, although this permission has now expired. There is a 20m x 40m outdoor ménage. The stable yard is currently occupied on a DIY livery basis and vacant possession will be provided upon completion.There is a range of traditional stone and modern steel frame farm buildings to the North of the house located adjacent to the stable yard. The largest steel frame agricultural barn was built in the 1970s to house beef cattle and now is used for general estate storage purposes. There is also a traditional Dutch barn for hay/straw storage. Located to the north of the entrance to the main driveway are two steel framed grain stores built in the 1990s.

The Arable land which extends to approximately 513 acres comprises mainly Grade 3 farmland with two distinct soil types.

To the east of the main house the land is flatter and comprises slightly acid loamy and clayey soils. The arable land is farmed in hand. Full cropping details can be provided if needed. The pasture paddocks extend to approximately 22 acres and are currently used by the DIY livery business at the stable yard.The woodland on the estate extends to approximately 184 acres and is strategically located to benefit the Estate’s private shoot. The woodlands are primarily deciduous with distinct groups; mixed broadleaves and conifers; broadleaves and conifer. Less than 8% of the woodland is classified as ancient woodland and a significant area was planted on farmland throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s. The woodlands generally have level to moderate slopes but are located in undulating topography which allows for harvesting and extraction to be carried out by conventional means. The Estate currently benefits from the Woodland Regeneration Grant.The shoot was run since the current owner purchased the Estate in 1960 and utilises the woodland and strategically planted cover crops to provide challenging pheasants and partridges. Feeder pens are located within the woodland. The shoot has not been run in the last two seasons. EPCs = D-FBrochuresWeb Details"

LOCATION
The twin villages of Aston Tirrold and Aston Upthorpe, which are merged together as one, lie at the foot of the Berkshire Downs in the valley just off the A417 Wantage to Streatley-on-Thames road as it extends across the Downlands close to the historic Ridgeway Path.
On the Downs there are numerous iron-age, Roman and Saxon earthworks and relics and the villages are believed to date from Saxon times as tradition recalls that King Ethelred and his brother Alfred (later the king), heard mass in the village before defeating the Danes nearby. Indeed Aston Upthorpe’s All Saints Church was built on Saxon foundations, whereas St Michael’s Church in Aston Tirrold, dates from 1080 and was later remodelled in the 13th century. The Astons had a tradition of Presbyterianism and in 1728 a Presbyterian chapel was built, being one of the oldest in existence in the country.
The villages boast numerous period properties of considerable character, reflecting the growth and prosperity through the centuries, many being listed as of significant historical and architectural interest. Nowadays the villages successfully retain their tranquil rural charm and way of life with farming and the land still being the dominant local activity, along with a notable thoroughbred Stud where many famous racehorse stallions stand. There is a village hall built in 1964, a sports/cricket ground, a village pub, and a repair garage.
There are good road communications to the surrounding towns including Didcot and Wallingford and the fast A34 dual carriageway linking Newbury with Oxford is a short drive. The M4 motorway at junction 12 or 13 is also within easy striking distance. Nearby stations at Cholsey and Didcot for trains to Reading and London Paddington.In addition to having well revered and outstanding local state primary and secondary schooling nearby, the area is also extremely well served by an excellent range of private schooling, of particular note; Cranford House School, The Oratory Preparatory School, Moulsford Preparatory School, St Andrews Preparatory School, The Oratory School, Pangbourne College, Brockhurst & Marlston House, Downe House, Rupert House School, Shiplake College, The Abbey School, Bradfield College, The Manor Preparatory School, Abingdon School, Abingdon Preparatory School, Radley College, and St Helen & St Katharine.
Crossrail (Elizabeth Line) services have commenced from Reading, connected to directly via multiple nearby railway stations such as Didcot, Cho;sey, and Goring & Streatley, with the full service scheduled to commence shortly, which together with the completed electrification of the line has significantly improved travelling times to East and West destinations.

A GRAND ENTRANCE

Built in 2000, Marlborough House presents a traditional, Georgian-style, complete with Doric columns and pediment. Inside it provides bright, spacious accommodation, enhanced by some traditional-style architectural features while also offering good, modern-day living areas.
Visitors enter via a large entrance hall, where a beautiful, butterfly staircase sweeps up to a galleried landing. This is immediately striking, and you can imagine new owners wishing to greet their guests in here as they arrive for a party or another social event.

STUNNING KITCHEN

Marlborough House has been carefully decorated in shades of soft grey and antique white throughout. The result is an elegant, calming ambience, which is enhanced by the current owners’ careful choice of furniture and accessories.
The kitchen is designed by Clive Christian with SubZero and Wolf appliances and complements the overall style of the interior perfectly. This is set within a fabulous section of the house which also incorporates a dining and family area. This is a superb communal space where people can gather to talk, prepare food and dine together; the room features a breakfast bar but there are also steps up into an unusual, circular dining area, complete with Clive Christian dining table and chairs.
This part of the house could also be an outstanding, less formal social space.

PERFECT ARRANGEMENT

At times, the owners might choose to welcome friends into their spacious drawing room, which has doors out on to the terrace, or into the dining room, where there is ample space for a large table and chairs.
You can look down on the dining room from the galleried landing above, where there is a library area. Both the kitchen and the dining room open into a sunny conservatory, where you can imagine sitting with the papers and a cup of coffee on a Sunday morning.
There is also a study, office, utility room and two cloakrooms within the main part of the house on the ground floor.

SUMPTUOUS SUITES

The sumptuous bedroom and bathroom accommodation is located on the first floor. To the right of the galleried landing is the impressive master suite.
This comprises a large bedroom and beautiful bathroom areas, with a free-standing bath, walk-in shower and his and hers sinks. There are also two separate dressing areas.
Another bedroom and en suite shower room is situated on this side of the property while in the other wing three further generous bedrooms, each with an en suite bathroom, can be found.
This is a home that would be ideal for a large family. The annexe, which is above the triple garage, has its own shower room and kitchenette, and would be ideal for staff or for a family member seeking some independence from the rest of the house.

OUTSTANDING LOCATION

Access to the swimming pool complex is via the conservatory. This area has been carefully maintained and includes a sauna and shower room.
Four sets of double doors open on to the garden, which is lovely when the weather is warm. There is a beautiful, decked area for entertaining, where you can imagine some wonderful garden and swimming pool parties taking place.

DescriptionHISTORY The Ryes is a Grade II listed country house in the hamlet of Little Henny on the Essex/Suffolk border. The house was designed by Robert Lugar in 1809 for Nathaniel Barnardiston and features in Nikolaus Pevsner?s architectural guide to ?The Buildings of England?. From the late 20th century to 2011 the house was used as a school, after which it was converted back into a private home by the current owners.The Ryes (originally called The Ryes Lodge) is an elegant Italianate villa constructed to designs by the architect Robert Lugar (c.1773-1855). Lugar was a contemporary of John Nash and practiced in London. He regularly exhibited his work at The Royal Academy. Howard Colvin, a prominent architectural historian, noted that Lugar was a practitioner who exploited the fashion of the picturesque, much in the same manner as Nash. Lugar exhibited a drawing for The Ryes (""Mr. Barnardiston's House"") at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1809.Later additions to the house, as mentioned in Pevsner?s description, were made to the property in 1884 with designs by E.F.Bishopp, an Ipswich architect commissioned by Colonel Nathaniel Barnardiston (1843 -1919).The Barnardistons were a well-founded aristocratic family with a long lineage of baronets. There are references held within online genealogy databases suggesting that the family did not relinquish ownership of The Ryes until the late 20th century, possibly when it was sold for conversion to a school.Main HouseEntered via a long gravel driveway, The Ryes is set in an elevated position overlooking rolling countryside. The Ryes is entered via a Doric portico with fluted columns and entablature into a grand hallway with beautiful parquet flooring and original cornicing, The Ryes has a perfect Georgian layout and most of the formal reception rooms surround this hallway.

Across its spacious footprint, expect carefully-considered interior design, state-of-the-art technologies and panoramic views over London. 

The Brick's striking exterior was designed with reference to 20th century architect, Edwin Lutyens. A pioneer of the Arts and Crafts movement, Lutyens was famed for his brickwork and stone masonry, use of local materials and simple yet solid structural form. His architectural vernacular is evidenced in the premium Petersen Tegl mixed-brick fac ade, interspersed with clean-line balconies and glazing. 

From the entrance lobby, take the private lift to the twelfth storey. Engineered timber floors lead from the hallway into an expansive open-plan kitchen, dining and reception room. There's a luminosity to the space, courtesy of the white matte emulsion walls and ceilings - brightened further by sunlight that pours through a series of full- height glass doors. At one end, the Wilson Frank kitchen makes a bold statement with black tongue-and-groove cabinetry, a copper sink and bronzed glass splashback. High spec appliances by Miele and Bosch are neatly integrated, while a dramatic pendant light softly illuminates the metal-topped central island. The rest of the room can be delineated between dining and seating zones, while the eye is drawn to an ambient suspended fireplace. Outside lies a large roof terrace, where brick columns give way to sweeping vistas across the city's inimitable skyline. 

Contemporary and calming, the principal bedroom suite is all pared-back interiors and swathes of natural light. Set on luxury Dorset twist carpet, the double bed faces onto full-height glazing that opens directly onto a second terrace. Behind a partition wall, a dedicated dressing area is crafted with bespoke wooden shelving. Beyond, the en suite bathroom has been finished with flawless attention to detail. The timeless Drummonds' freestanding bath is backdropped by a parquet tile wall. A marble-topped dual vanity - complete with gilded Hansgrohe taps - has a playful twist with bold botanic wallpaper. A frosted Crittall-style door reveals a large rainfall shower wrapped in muted mosaic stone tiles. Two further bedroom suites, which offer versatility to be used as studies or exercise rooms, also enjoy far-reaching views across the surrounding cityscape. 

Residents can also make use of two communal gardens; verdant, landscaped spaces that belie The Brick's thoroughly urban location. Inspired by celebrated horticulturalist Gertrude Jekyll and her partnership with Edwin Lutyens, the sprawling roof terrace showcases perennials and planters contained in red brick parapets. It's one of London's largest private roof terraces - tailor- made to capitalise on London's warmer months. 

Caught between Notting Hill, Maida Hill and North Kensington, The Brick i s located in one of London's most eclectic and sought-after spots. There's a community feel to Golborne Road, where locals flock to Lisboa and Layla Bakery for freshly-baked goods. Retail therapy comes in the form of Portobello Road's vintage boutiques, or Westfield Shopping Centre's world-class retailers. Stroll down Little Venice, the tranquil towpath lined with colourful barges and handsome Georgian townhouses. Stop by the Theatre Cafe  before seeing a show at Regent's Park Open Air Theatre, a fixture in the capital's summertime calendar. Or for something closer to home, it's a short walk to local landmark The Electric Cinema - followed by dinner at Laylow."

DescriptionTaking advantage of stunning views across the Kentish Weald, Waterfield House sits nestled within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.The concept of the dwelling was to be designed of both the earth and sky. A solid, masonry base was partially dug into the hillside, and extended out into the landscape with garden walls, thus hiding its true scale from afar. Materials were chosen as a nod to the natural tones found within the existing site strata. The plinth provides opportunity to house the more private bedroom and entertainment spaces and creates a base for the lighter, dual aspect living spaces to be located on the upper level.The upper ‘sky’ floor sits at tree canopy level, taking  advantage of stunning views down the valley. Four large living areas are arranged in a linear sequence of interconnected spaces, divided with custom cabinets, and linked to the lower ground floor with a central atrium. Large sliding glazed doors sit behind movable Larch shutters, which open and close to give varying degrees of shading, ventilation, and privacy, whilst casting dappled shadows throughout the day.A separate study and kitchen are hidden within the living spaces. In addition there is a fully equipped gym and cinema room to the lower floor. To the rear, the building merges into the landscape at the top of the site, enclosing a modest, south-facing courtyard providing shelter from the elements whilst allowing light deep into the plan.LocationWaterfield House is located in a wonderful rural position, within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, just a mile from the beautiful and sought-after village of Goudhurst which is well known for its pretty centre with ancient church, duck pond, period buildings, inns and restaurants. The regional centre of Royal Tunbridge Wells provides an extensive range of shopping, commercial, recreational and cultural facilities, as well as a mainline train service to London Charing Cross and Cannon Street in under the hour. Train services to London are also available from nearby Marden and Staplehurst. The A21 provides access to the south coast, the M25 and national motorway network with connections to London Gatwick and Heathrow airports, the Channel Tunnel and ferry ports. There is a good selection of state and private schools in the area including Cranbrook School, Tonbridge and Sevenoaks public schools, Kent College for Girls, Marlborough House and St Ronans at Hawkhurst, Benenden School and Sutton Valence.

A particular local favourite is The Waverley, a chic steak and seafood restaurant with cocktail bar. With cinemas, theatres, local art galleries, museums and historic houses and gardens nearby, there is never a shortage of things to do.The town is near junction 11 of the M25 and is on a fast train line into London Waterloo.

The accommodation spans two floors and exudes a timeless appeal with its abundance of period features. The ground floor currently comprises of a reception hall divided into two areas with a cloakroom and access down to the cellar with a newly installed central heating boiler. The owners have also re-wired the house and installed full-fibre broadband which provides incredible wired speeds of up to 800mb/s and 200mb/s on wifi.

There is also a utility room and walk-in pantry located in this area. Stairs lead up to a large games room/office which has a wealth of beams and features and a viewing area that overlooks the 18th Century hay barn.  Access to the barn is located off the annexe reception room below and has a double height vaulted ceiling, beams galore and four large double height barn doors located in the four corners.

There is an incredible amount of space throughout the ground floor and this allows plenty of flexibility as to how the space could be used. Upstairs in the main house are four further double bedrooms with built in wardrobes and the family bathroom.The owners have had plans and a planning report drawn up to show some realistic examples of just how flexible and accommodating Home Farm could be. These plans introduce a principal bedroom suite in the annexe area and an ensuite off the main bedroom upstairs in the main house. The plans also include a reconfiguration of the kitchen space and transforming the barn into an incredible leisure complex with a mezzanine gym area overlooking a pool and spa area. Alternatively the barn could be used as a vast open plan kitchen / living space or even an office space to run a home business from (all STPP).

The property was built in 1925 by renowned local architect Harold Falkner, for Lady Diana Courtauld in the attractive William and Mary style.

In recent years, the original house has been carefully extended and refurbished, including an extension to create further living accommodation and a leisure complex attached to the house. This has been sympathetically created to enable wonderful symmetry to the front and rear facades. The house provides in excess of 9,500 sq ft with exceptional lateral space, proportions and light.

It is thought to have been built sometime in the late 1850s forming part of a programme of modernisation of the Denbies Estate, which was acquired by Thomas Cubitt in 1850.During the first half of the 19th century, Thomas Cubitt was perhaps the most important builder in London and of notable country houses. In London, he was the creator of Belgravia and parts of Bloomsbury and was chosen to carry out extensions to Buckingham Palace. Amongst his many notable country projects were Osborne House on the Isle of Wight which he built together with Prince Albert, and Polesden Lacey, quite close to the Estate. It was perhaps during the building of Polesden Lacey that he became familiar with the beautiful North Downs countryside of Surrey, which, even in those days, had convenient access to London. Twenty-five years after the building of Polesden Lacey, he acquired the Denbies Estate.The exact date of Chapel House's construction is not known, but there is a watercolour dated 1869, which shows the house clearly and firmly entrenched in its setting. We understand the house was adapted in the 1950s, with the wing on the north elevation being demolished and the removal of the rear staircase. In the early 60s, the existing coach house was converted at the east of the house to create a reception room on the ground floor as well as two bedrooms and a bathroom.The beautifully landscaped gardens and grounds are a particular feature of the estate. There are extensive lawned areas and herbaceous borders affording a wealth of colour throughout the seasons. The gardens have been designed to make the most of the surrounding countryside. There are an array of outbuildings positioned close to the main house and a tennis court positioned between the house and the stables. The swimming pool was built in the 70's and is currently an ornamental pool. The gardens and grounds extend to around 3.5 acres whilst there is a belt of woodland towards the top of the hill behind the house which offers a further 6.5 acres.Chapel House is situated on the edge of Westhumble amongst National Trust land close to Box Hill. Located within The Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, this stunning home benefits from an outstanding outlook over the surrounding countryside. Being set well back from a country lane and surrounded by its own extensive grounds, the property enjoys a high level of privacy and seclusion whilst being within easy reach of all necessary amenities and communications.Around half a mile away is the mainline train station of Box Hill and Westhumble. Chapel House is located near the traditional and well-regarded market town of Dorking, which provides a range of local and regional services. The property is extremely well served by road and rail for access to London and the international airports of Heathrow and Gatwick.Beaverbrook Hotel and Spa in Leatherhead offers sporting and entertainment experiences of the highest calibre, with a 5* Hotel and Spa, fine dining Japanese Grill, cookery school and an 18-hole golf course which opened in 2016. Denbies Winery and the RACCountry Club are nearby, as is the High Ashurst Outdoor Education Centre in Mickleham, which offers a wide range of pursuits, including climbing, abseiling, trail biking and adventure walking, amongst others. Opposite the house, there is off-road access to Ranmore Common, with its extensive network of bridleways and footpaths.Golf courses nearby include; Wisley, Betchworth and Tyrrells Wood. Slightly further afield but within Surrey are the internationally renowned golf courses of Wentworth and Sunningdale. Nearby horse racing includes; Sandown Park, Epsom, Lingfield, Ascot and Goodwood.Notable private schools include; London Freeman's, St John's, Reigate Grammar, Cranleigh, Box Hill, St Teresa's, Cranmore, Downsend and Christ's Hospital.

With origins dating to the sixteenth century together with a fine Georgian addition to the front, the house has the grace of the neo classical period, together with the warmth of the earlier architectural style. The charming blend of the two eras has resulted in characterful accommodation extending to in excess of 3,970 square feet, plus a cellar, which is laid out over three floors. Exteriors to the rear are typical of the late medieval period and are of mellow brick with multi pane windows and tile hanging under a peg-tiled roof, whilst the front portion is early nineteenth century with Georgian symmetrical, painted render, under a slate-tiled roofline and sash windows. Internally, again the two distinctive styles marry together beautifully with exposed oak beams and flagstone floors sitting alongside the refinement of the later addition. Ceiling heights are generous throughout and room sizes well proportioned, while the windows provide for an abundance of natural light as well as affording views over the grounds and farther afield. The two formal reception rooms each have fireplaces, one marble and one with ornately carved timber. Elsewhere are two informal receptions rooms – the sitting room where the ceiling beams are painted and there is a brick fireplace with wood burning stove and the large family room, which has oak flooring and a series of shelving. The farmhouse style kitchen/breakfast room has tiled flooring and is fitted with a range of cabinetry, granite work surfaces and a gas Aga.  The six bedrooms are laid out over the upper two levels with the principal suite having the benefit of an en-suite bathroom.

Beneath the inspired addition of a glazed vaulted ceiling a superb double aspect sitting room produces an outstanding space in which to relax and entertain. The rich timber tones of its wood floor complement a heritage palette, a working fireplace creates a traditional focal point and while window seats proffer a peaceful spot to sit and admire your surroundings French doors connect you with the secluded terracing.  Charming bay windows in the adjacent family and dining rooms offer further vantage points to enjoy the idyllic  vistas, and whilst the tastefully modern family room is a great place to spend time together, the formal dining room transports you back in time with its exposed ceiling beams, distinguished panelling and quintessential fireplace. A stylish contemporary fitted study sits peacefully away from the reception rooms for a cherished work/life balance. With views that take in the gardens and swimming pool, across the entrance hall the pared-back aesthetics continue in a stunning kitchen/breakfast room where dual sets of French doors give daily life every opportunity to filter out in to the summer sun. The considerable breakfast room with its feature alcove seating is equally suited for family meals or evenings entertaining friends and flows fluidly into a first class kitchen where the considered expanse of glazing stretches up to a further vaulted ceiling. Supremely well appointed, its sleek cabinetry is topped with granite and designed to accommodate a range cooker and an American style fridge freezer. A matching central island with a waterfall countertop and bar stool overhang gives delineation to the open plan layout, while sofa space beneath the apex windows gives you the excuse to sit with a glass of wine and catch up on the day’s events while you cook. An adjoining fitted utility room with side access keeps laundry appliances hidden from view, and a ground floor cloakroom sits discreetly back from the entrance hall. With natural light tumbling down from each of the galleried landings above, the sweeping curve of a classic turning staircase gently guides you upstairs where the consistent design themes are echoed throughout six exceptional double bedrooms. Solid oak banisters with charming heart detailing give a rich warming contrast to the plush carpeting that runs cohesively underfoot, while marvellously large casement windows allow the gardens to add a picturesque backdrop at every turn. Commendably sized and styled, four large bedrooms and three deluxe bath/shower rooms, with sumptuous suites that have roll top baths and waterfall showers, pepper the first floor giving everyone their own sense of space and luxury. Upstairs on the top floor two equally impressive bedrooms include one with an en suite shower room and generate the option of having a TV room or study if needed. Set within the tranquillity and seclusion of capacious grounds and gardens of 0.66 acres Weavers is perfectly placed in The Hockering to create its own wonderful semi-rural idyll whilst still being in a central Woking location. Tucked back from Danes Hill this prestigious home is sequestered by extensive wrap-around lawns framed by the evergreen foliage of gloriously high hedging, majestically tall trees and statuesque conifers. It benefits from detached double garaging that has bi-fold doors, direct garden access and its own separate entrance to the grounds from Clear Down. The French doors of the kitchen/breakfast room and sitting room entice you onto elegant terracing for al fresco dining, the simplicity of restful summer afternoons or a last glass of wine while watching the sun go down. An outdoor swimming pool and paved patio lend a tremendous destination on hot sunny days, and a brick built summer house is heavenly hideaway with a good book or the weekend papers.Weavers is situated in the highly regarded area of South Woking, just minutes from Woking Town Centre and train station. Woking is a thriving town and is subject to much improvement and investment. It currently provides a full range of shopping, leisure and cultural amenities. In addition, the main line station provides fast and frequent connections to London Waterloo with its 26 min fast train. Road links are also excellent, with the A3 and A30 for London and the M25 for the Heathrow and Gatwick airports and the national motorway network.BrochuresParticulars"

With sensitive interventions over the years, the home now spans some 4,100 sq ft and is awash with original vernacular features and a finely executed exposed timber frame. Internally, there are five bedrooms and a flow of reception rooms, while externally manicured grounds and a private gated entrance surround the hall. Pinner is an exceptionally well-connected suburb, with a bustling high street and excellent transport links. Pinner station is on the Metropolitan Line and is a mere 9-minute walk from the house, while the Overground service is available at Hatch End station, a little further afield.

Setting the Scene

The Grade II*-listed hall is a distinctive post-medieval asymmetrical lobby-entry house. With a history as a yeoman’s house, the hall once formed part of the Manor of Harrow and its surrounding curtilage. West End Lane is unique in that it retains an original smoke bay, a timber structure that would have been used to prevent smoke from an internal open hearth reaching every corner of the building’s interior. A precursor to what we now know as an inglenook fireplace, smoke bays were sealed off from the rest of the house to allow smoke to escape. These later evolved into smoke hoods, and then the modern chimney we know today. There are few remaining examples of post-medieval smoke bays, as they were only constructed during a short period in the early 16th century. For more information, please see the History section.

The Grand Tour

Accessed via a stooped timber porch, the entrance hall is a handsome space with characterful checkerboard flags. Leading from here, the expansive main reception room unfolds. Chamfered oak beams still bear the builders marks from circa 1540, with crisp white lime-plastered panels interspaced among the woodwork. A vast space with dual aspect windows, the room has a large, open brick fireplace which is perfect for use in cooler months and deep pile carpets underfoot.

Adjacent the main reception room is a secondary drawing room. Finished in neutral shades of white, the room is flooded with natural light from an expansive window spanning the length of the rear wall; a timber window seat runs beneath, the perfect spot for reading a book on a sunny afternoon. The room has a wide inglenook with a unique brick fireplace lying at its centre.

Overlooking the quiet front gardens and private gravelled drive is the kitchen and dining room. An open-plan space with glazing on three sides, the room is partially laid with terracotta tiles underfoot and features original beam work. A bank of simple cabinets lines the walls of the kitchen, with a central island overlooking the dining room; these are topped with hardy slate. From the kitchen, there is a large utility room which leads to the garages.

Ascending one of two staircases, the upper floor of the house unfolds with five bedrooms, four bathrooms and a separate study. At the far end of the plan is the primary bedroom, with soaring ceiling heights and original exposed timber. Nearly twenty feet high, the space has a steep pitch to the roof, which draws the eye upwards and adds emphasis to the volume of the space. A brick-built open fireplace sits in the corner and the room has dual-aspect views over the front and rear of the home.

Adjacent to the primary bedroom is a secondary bedroom of similar size. The space has a broad window overlooking the front gardens and a later-Victorian fireplace in the centre of one wall. Underfoot, spectacular wide floorboards run throughout the room; made from elm, their quality and width is incomparable with modern-day timber. Leading on from the bedroom is a large Jack and Jill bathroom with a separate entrance from the main hallway; the space has a freestanding bath, shower, vanity and WC.

The other end of the plan is home to three bedrooms, all of which overlook the rear and side gardens. Exposed beams and lime plaster provide continuity throughout. A further three bathrooms intersect the rooms.

The Great Outdoors

A gravelled driveway unfolds via a wide lych gate, leading to the house and its 0.66 acre plot, while a second set of gates allows for in-out access. Encircled with well established trees, the front and rear gardens are an oasis of privacy. To the rear, there is a heated kidney-shaped pool encompassed by patios and seating areas overlooking a rolling lawn. The current owners have implemented an array of well-established planting, including clipped topiary, box edgings, numerous bushes and shrubs and a small olive grove..

Externally, there is a potting shed, pool house and handsome garden room. Adjoining the house there is also a large garage complex with space for up to six cars, as well as a studio or workshop.

Out and About

Pinner’s high street has maintained many of its 18th-century buildings which now house a wide variety of independent and larger retailers. As well as an M&S, there are several cafes and restaurants providing options for international cuisine. The Queen’s Head pub, with its marvellous terrace, is the perfect spot for sundowners and Beer Asylum has, unsurprisingly, a fantastic selection of brews only a 7-minute walk away.

The area is awash with activities for all ages. A 2-minute walk north of the Hall is Pinner Recreation Ground, London’s first wood meadow; south leads to Pinner Memorial Park, a popular destination with both adults and children for its picturesque lake, bowls club, play area, and café. The Heath Robinson Museum is located on its western edge where the public can view the oeuvre of work from the renowned landscape artist, cartoonist, illustrator, and social historian. Adjacent to the park is Pinner’s own lawn tennis club.

Further afield, Ruislip Park Stables is a 5-minute drive, with the common providing an excellent location for those who ride or would like to do so. The common is also home to a beautiful Lido and Duck Pond Market, a farmers market famed for its delicious organic produce.

Pinner has great access to the M1, M40, and M25 motorways, all of which are within 10 miles. Pinner station is on the Metropolitan Line and is a mere 9-minute walk. The Overground service is available at Hatch End Station, reachable by car in 6 minutes.

DescriptionSunnyridges provides an exciting opportunity to further develop an enviable plot on the edge of a highly desirable village with its own c.40m of river frontage to the Thames with mooring and riparian rights. The present house, originally built around 1950, has been extensively remodelled over the years, now providing comfortable accommodation exceeding 4100 sq ft, including the garage and outbuildings. On the ground floor is a well-appointed kitchen with breakfast bar and utility room off, dining room, sitting room and conservatory, study, cloakroom, two bedrooms and a shower room. On the first floor are two bedrooms, one facing towards the front overlooking the lake, the other towards the rear, and a family bathroom. There is a double garage and separate adjoining single garage/storage area with electric doors, with stairs to a first floor.In 2015, permission was granted under the Neighbourhood Consultation Scheme (P15/S1054/PDH) for an extension of 846 cubic metres using permitted development rights. Subsequently, modified plans were produced by a local architect in 2018, and planning granted (P18/S2728/HH), to extensively extend the existing house to create a seven bedroom two storey house of over 6700 sq ft (including existing garage and outbuildings) with a 17 x 3m indoor pool. These permissions, now lapsed, indicate the potential possibilities this plot affords. Details can be viewed online on the South Oxfordshire District Council website:   (Planning references as above).The proposed house included a generous entrance hall, large kitchen/dining/living room, sitting room, conservatory, study, utility/boot room, cloakroom and wine cellar. A spa complex included a pool, sauna, changing room with shower, gym and cloakroom. A second staircase from the pool afforded direct access to the principal bedroom suite. On the first floor, the principal bedroom had a dressing room and en suite bathroom. There were six further bedrooms (three with en suite facilities) and a family bathroom.OutsideThe present house is set well back off the road and enjoys views over the lake to the front, and the large garden and to the river and beyond. The extensive gardens are a particularly impressive feature of this property and are a rare find, particularly with a riverside setting. A recent addition to the grounds is an En-Tout-Cas multi-use tennis court.At the end of the garden is an idyllically situated summerhouse with views down the river to Wittenham Clumps. There are also three further outbuildings adjacent to the summerhouse, the middle one has a separate electric supply. Steps allow access down the bank to the river. A large flat grassed area spans the c.40m of riverbank with an inlet to one end used by the current owner to access the river for swimming, kayaking and paddleboarding, and a wooden mooring jetty.In the last year, the Environment Agency have approved the installation of an oak piling system extending around the inlet and along the full extent of the bank to enhance the site, and allow for the potential creation of a boathouse (subject to planning).There is a close community around the river, consisting of weekend boaters, anglers, runners and dog walkers, all keen admirers of the river’s sleepy passage through some of Oxfordshire’s most beautiful uninterrupted countryside. It is possible to boat along the river to the centre of Oxford, taking in the villages of Clifton Hampden, Culham and Abingdon en route.LocationSituated in South Oxfordshire at the confluence of the River Thame and River Thames, Dorchester on-Thames is steeped in history. Well known for its historic Abbey built for Augustinian monks in 1140, which later became the parish church at the dissolution of the monasteries, the monastic guest house beside the Abbey is now a museum and tea room and two of the former coaching inns are now pubs.Historic Dorchester-on-Thames is a thriving and active village which offers pre and primary schools, coop store, hairdresser, restaurants and hotels. There are fishing and sailing clubs on the lakes, football and cricket clubs, three pubs, village hall, shop, the Abbey and Catholic church and a primary school. Also in the village is Bishop Court Farm with its Snug Café which hosts regular jazz sessions as well as myriad other activities. The nearby market towns of Abingdon, Wallingford and Oxford amply provide for everyday shopping and leisure requirements. Footpaths and bridleways abound, both along the Thames and towards Wittenham Clumps. The area is well served for a wide selection of state and independent schools. Independent schools include Moulsford Preparatory School, Cranford House, The Oratory Prep, Abingdon Prep, Radley College, Abingdon School and of course the highly regarded Oxford schools. State Schools include the nearby Europa international school, a multilingual 4-18 school offering the chance to develop language skills at a young age and study the IB, St Birinus C of E Primary in the village and the secondary in Wallingford.Road links are excellent via the A34, A329 and the Oxford ring road, providing access to the M4 and M40. There is a choice for the London commute by train; From Didcot Parkway into Paddington (approx. journey time of around 36 minutes) or from Reading (25 minutes), or alternatively into Marylebone from Haddenham & Thame (from 37 minutes) or Oxford Parkway. There are two excellent coach services into London, Oxford Tube and X90, which run at regular intervals 24 hours per day from Oxford. Airline coaches also provide a regular service to Heathrow or Gatwick from Oxford or Lewknor.Square Footage: 4,112 sq ft

With origins dating to 1913 during the early years of George Vth’s reign, the house was formerly the vicarage to the parish church of St Luke’s, which is close by. Skilfully extended and refurbished by the present owners, the charming blend of the two eras has resulted in substantial, characterful accommodation extending to in excess of 6,340 square feet, which is laid out over three floors. Exteriors are typical of the period with mellow red brick and painted render to the first floor, under a pitched tiled roof. Ceilings are generous throughout, while windows and French doors are large, offering a fine prospect over the grounds and beyond. Internally, again the balance of the period features and new additions is seamless. Handsome fireplaces of various styles have either been restored from the original or complementary surrounds installed. The original timber flooring has been refurbished, new oak boards laid throughout the rest of the house including many of the bedrooms and tiled floors – some with under floor heating - in the open plan kitchen/dining area and orangery, reception hall and bath/shower rooms. The two formal reception rooms each have fireplaces, one stone with a wood burning stove and one with painted carved timber. Elsewhere are two informal receptions rooms – the sitting room, a cosy space just off the kitchen and the superb family/cinema room where there is a handy secondary staircase to the upper levels – as well as a study. The kitchen/orangery is a magnificent space and flooded with natural light. The kitchen area is furnished with a range of hand painted floor and base units with black granite work surfaces to include a large central island. Appliances include an oil fired Aga with companion and there is a walk-in pantry. The orangery has eight pairs of French doors opening out to the rear terracing and is a wonderful place for family living but also for enjoying the outside, from the inside at all times of the year.
In total there are eight bedrooms arranged over the upper two levels, with many having built in storage.

That’s why it is unique and one of the very few detached houses in Cholmeley Park. His family sold to us, so this is only the second time in 80 years that the house is up for sale.We looked at 80 houses around London, we wanted something wide and lateral for a family to grow up in, rooms with high ceilings, a beautiful space but also relaxed and homely. As soon as we walked in, we knew this house was it.There was another dimension to first seeing that house though. We came to view it from our jobs in The City, only 20 minutes to Highgate tube, and soon after we emerged from the station, we were in this leafy green space, and it was very quiet. That was our first introduction to what an extraordinarily beautiful part of London this is and how easy it is to access it all on foot.Living in this house means being able to walk to school (to great schools) and that brought enormous quality to our everyday lives for many years. To be so close to, and not need the car for, the array of independent shops, cafes and restaurants in Highgate, is wonderful and something of a privilege. Picnics and concerts at Kenwood, Lauderdale House, the theatre in Hampstead, Waterlow Park and the stunning Parkland Walk along the route of the old railway line, these are all on our doorstep.And, as people who thrive on a mix of the cosmopolitan and natural world, we have spent the last fifteen years living within a few minutes’ walk of two of the oldest woods in England; Highgate Woods and Queen's Woods. That’s an extraordinary thing to be able to say about a home less 20 minutes from the West End and The City.We refurbished the house from top to bottom, retaining the house’s character whilst making it more interconnected.We wanted the whole of the back to be open, and for the garden to become part of the living space, so we can entertain freely and have a fluid, sociable feel to everything. We also added a third floor, creating two bedrooms and a bathroom. We get the sun all day and we tend to follow it, using all parts of the house and gardens. The rear garden is east facing and in spring and summer we start the day here, open plan. We sit out front in the afternoons and evenings. The walled garden means that it is very private and totally secure for children.We have had a carpenter build a bookcase into the balustrade,  which runs up the light, airy stairwell from the ground floor all the way up to the top of the house. We think of it as the Tree of Knowledge because our lives’ work, adventures and experiences are reflected in the tons of exciting books on its shelves.The bookcase synergistically replicates what the British library have done with their archive of precious books in the central atrium.We knew we had found a wonderful home with this house, but we could never have envisaged the quality of life in Cholmeley Park itself. There’s an extremely low churn of neighbours. It’s a very stable place of deep-rooted families and retirees and there's a real communal feel to our street. It’s a village in itself. People look out for each other and that is something we consider priceless.We are excited about where we're going next. The temptation to stay in this house we love so much is tangible, but the desire and compulsion to move forward to our next professional challenge in a different country is even greater. We know we are leaving a unique home and a magical neighbourhood, and we want the next owners to be as deeply happy as we have been.''EPC Rating: DGardenRearParking - Secure Gated"

It can be found in Hotham Hall, on a quiet residential street, moments from Putney and the Thames, and within easy reach of Barnes and its green spaces.

Hotham Hall was built in 1913 as a community hall and later became a venue for concerts and political meetings, hosting the Rolling Stones and The Who, and former Prime Ministers, Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Anthony Eden. It was converted into eight apartments in the 1990s and was designed and finished to an exacting standard throughout.

The Tour

This particular apartment was updated to a design by murphy | davé architects. It is located at the southern corner and has the largest footprint of any in the building. Entry is via the residents parking area and to a large communal hallway, leading in turn, to the apartment and a private entrance hall.

This opens to a galleried landing area, once used by the owner as a dining room, which overlooks the central, double-height reception. The apartment is designed with excellent spatial ingenuity, set over a series of stepped levels with sliding and pocket doors offering the versatility of openness and privacy when needed. Just off the living space are two rooms, one used as a gym, the other a study which is revealed by a full-height, sliding door clad in a patchwork of red hide.

The kitchen lies opposite and is designed by Bulthaup, with appliances by Miele and Neff. Next to it is a dining space, set beneath double-height glazing which opens externally to cedar decking and steps up to the garden.

The bedrooms are arranged around the central living space, with two in the north-eastern corner and the master at the southern end. This is accessed from the gallery via a raised, walk-through dressing room and has a large en suite bathroom, with walk-in shower and fittings by Vola. Steps descend to the bedroom area; a wonderful space surrounded by glazing, overlooking a reflection pool and with views to the garden.

Sharing this southerly aspect is an entertainment room, with a Kodac-painted projector wall and elegant Crittall-style doors that open to the garden and an immaculate seating area.

Inside, flooring is a combination of limestone, oak, and leather in the master bedroom, with underfloor heating throughout and trench heaters beneath the glazed aspects.

Outside Space

The gardens have been designed to be incredibly low-maintenance, with Japanese-style gravel sections, and to provide year round interest with evergreens such as olive trees, Mediterranean palms and bamboo, and Sumac for the warmer months.

The Area

Hotham Hall is located close to the shops, restaurants and transport facilities of Putney High Street. Wandsworth Park, Barnes and the Wetlands nature reserve, Bishops Park and Hurlingham Park are all within easy reach.

There are a number of great pubs, bars and cafes in the area including family-owned restaurant Ma Goa, craft beer shop Ghost Whale and The Duke’s Head by Putney’s idyllic riverside.

A little further afield, is Southside Wandsworth shopping centre and the newly introduced Ram Quarter, along the River Wandle, which hosts events with Backyard Cinema and is home to speciality coffee shop, Story Coffee. Barnes 'village' is also close by for a further selection of restaurants, cafe's and shops.

East Putney station (District Line) and Putney station (Overground services to London Waterloo and towards the South-East) are within walking distance. There are also a number of good bus routes and easy access to the A3.

This charming and beautifully presented Grade ll listed Georgian property, built early in the 18th century, sits in a coveted location occupying a large corner plot, adjacent to the River Thames, with its original walled garden and offering a separate garage and off street parking. Langham Cottage is a fine example of an exquisite, detached, double fronted Georgian cottage, presenting in effect a riverside country retreat, yet only half an hour from Waterloo Station.   The house is approached from Sion Row, through an entrance gate into a secluded walled front garden. A York stone path leads to the patios and front door, with ornate wooden architrave and triangular pediment above, opening to the entrance hall and thus leading to the beautifully configured living space and accommodation. Extensive restoration works, designed by leading Georgian architect Donald Insall Associates, were undertaken in 2015/16 by the current owners and have further enhanced the charm of this beautiful house. Many period features were left in place, while the house has been brought most  sympathetically into the 21st Century, as a comfortable and secluded home.  This extraordinary property in brief comprises; on the ground floor: entrance porch, two reception rooms, study, kitchen by de Vol, larder, a wine cellar, utility area, downstairs WC and boot hallway; on the first and second floors: four bedrooms, two bathrooms, all finished to a very high standard.

Langham Cottage is within minutes of the open spaces of Marble Hill House and Park, Orleans House Gallery and Gardens and lies just across the river from Ham House via Hammertons Ferry. The property sits within one of the rarest and most coveted of locations in South West London – perfect for walks in the historic Arcadian environs from Richmond Palace to Hampton Court. The splendour of Royal Richmond Park is half an hours walk away along the river, across historic Richmond Bridge, passing many independent coffee shops.The house is within close proximity of Twickenham town centre, including Waterstones, Gails and a large Waitrose , whilst being within reach of many of the area’s superb retail attractions such as the pedestrianised Church Street, where you will find a varied collection of pubs, restaurants, cafes and artisan shops.

Impressive properties on substantial plots line the wide, tree-lined road which is situated between Wanstead High Street to the North, including Wanstead's Central Line Tube Station at the northerly end of The Green, and the iconic Grade I listed Georgian church of St. Mary's to the South. Green space is all encompassing in this conservation area, with Wanstead's Cricket, Tennis, Bowling and Golf Clubs all adjacent to the property (with grounds visible from the first floor).  Additionally, Wanstead Park, a former hunting ground of Henry VII, offers ornamental lakes and grounds for scenic walks.  The commencement of Epping Forest (at the end of Overton Drive) is only 0.3 miles away, also providing extensive walking opportunities and significant bridleway access.""Wyndlawn"", built in 1926, marks the beginning of St. Mary's Avenue and comprises a large detached home of approximately 2,371 square feet.  By virtue of its positioning, this large corner plot comprises one of the most significant sized plots on St. Mary's Avenue, providing a substantial South / Easterly garden which is very private and not overlooked at all on one side; one of the many rare attributes of this home. Another rare attribute comprises the private equestrian facility (possibly the only private home in the area with stables), together with a separate double garage with studio and bathroom on the first floor, with an attached shed to one side of the garages. A deep, smart frontage bordered by intricate wrought iron railings provides a perfect entrance to the home and leads into a furnished entrance hall, where an attractive original central staircase dominates the space.  A well-proportioned formal sitting room leads to a large dining room, both benefiting from impressive views across the immaculate gardens, with natural light enabled by an extensive run of windows on the majority of walls.  The large retro kitchen / diner can be accessed directly via the formal dining room or the central entrance hall and is again spacious and bright with a separate pantry.  A convenient downstairs bathroom and a cellar are also accessible from the ground floor.To the first floor, a substantial landing area leads to five bedrooms and a family bathroom, of which the principal bedroom enjoys Chippendale-fitted furniture with a good deal of surrounding floor space and dual aspect windows.  There are two further good-sized doubles which also include views of St. Mary's Church and Wanstead Golf Course, and one providing access to good-sized eaves storage; another bedroom is currently used as a combination of dressing room and single bedroom and there is a further smaller study / potential single bedroom.  The retro family bathroom comfortably accommodates a bathroom suite and separate shower, with natural light flooding in from a combination of windows and glass block tiles.  The loft provides ample storage space or opportunity to expand the already generous living accommodation (STPC).Externally, the extremely private South / Easterly garden begins with a wraparound patio accessed from both formal reception rooms and kitchen and includes a raised veranda area which is accessible directly from the dining room; the perfect place to relax, dine and entertain al fresco.  The manicured lawn, bordered by established shrubs and trees, leads to a pair of stables (constructed by Scotts of Thrapston) positioned to the rear of the plot, with a detached double garage, electric garage doors accessible from Overton Drive and hard-standing providing plenty of room for secure parking.  To the rear of the double garage, stairs lead to a first floor studio with a small bathroom (including sits-bath, WC and sink), a potential kitchenette area and eaves storage, providing usage as an annexe or outside office area with facilities.  A brick-built storage shed, a composting facility and an additional large storage room attached to the double garage are also incorporated into this rear area allowing for facilities to be available without being in sight of the house or garden - this area lends itself well to development subject to the usual planning consents.

Standing tall at the end of Burdon Lane in the village of Cheam; neighbouring the beautiful Banstead Downs Golf Club, is something really rather special. Built in 1903, this executive 6 bedroom Edwardian home offers all the period charm you would expect, existing in harmony alongside the modern home comforts we have grown to love in equal measure.Ask a dozen people what their favourite architectural era is, and I suspect a high percentage will say Edwardian; and who could blame them. There`s lots to like, and actually well over a hundred years on and they are more relevant as modern day homes as they`ve ever been. Believed to have been built around 1903, this is as good an example of a stylish Edwardian home as you will see, in my view at least. The family who currently own the property have not only been instrumental in conceiving a thorough restoration and refurbishment programme, but they have executed it with a real understanding of how to combine the character and charm of the original era with the needs and standards of modern day living, and all at the very highest standard.With accommodation of some 3270 sq ft over three floors, this is a well balanced home; something you get an instant sense of as you step in to the Entrance hall, off which is the cloakroom, and through in to the reception hall, which provides access to most of the main ground floor rooms, including dining room, sitting room, which leads in to the beautiful conservatory, and kitchen/breakfast room which goes through to the utility and in turn to the rear garden. The kitchen is Tom Howley, and the quality is evident in every square inch. To the first floor are located four of the six bedrooms, including the main bedroom and en-suite, and the large family bathroom. And to the top floor, are bedrooms five and six, which are served by a further bathroom. In addition, there is also a basement below, accessed from the kitchen, which comprises of three storage areas.The list of features and specification on this beautiful home are almost endless, but highlights include; Edwardian style tiled floor to hallway, stained glass windows, herringbone wooden floors, ornate cornicing, hand built and painted bespoke kitchen with granite tops and porcelain tiled flooring, modern bathrooms, downlighting, American style shutters, and all beautifully presented throughout.  To the outside, the property is approached via two sets of wrought iron gates with private intercom, leading on to a drive a forecourt area giving access to the garage and rear gardens. The gardens to the front and rear have been beautifully designed and tendered, making the most of this large, south facing. Secluded plot on the edge of Banstead Downs Golf Club.The location is ideal for commuters with Cheam Station walking distance from the house, as is the village of Cheam with a wonderful combination of High Street shops, Independent shops and restaurants and cafes. Trains from Cheam are into London within 40 minutes, Schooling is also within easy reach with St Dunstans C of E Primary School, Cuddington Croft Primary School, Nonsuch High School for Girls, Cheam High School for Girls, Sutton Grammar School for Boys all being close by.

Currently arranged with the upper portion as a four-bedroom home and lower-ground floor as a self-contained flat, the interiors span some 3,065 sq ft and unfold across five floors. Two tranquil private terraces overlook the garden to the rear and the City skyline to the front. The bucolic, west-facing garden is awash with fragrant salvias, dahlias and jasmine, and has a timber workshop at the end. Positioned just off historic Clissold Park and a short walk from much-loved Newington Green, Burma Road is wonderfully positioned. Canonbury, a 15-minute walk away, runs overground trains to Highbury & Islington, Shoreditch High Street and Stratford, as well as Camden and Hampstead. Dalston Kingsland and Dalston Junction overground stations are also within easy reach.

Setting the Scene

Previously a sizeable estate on the outskirts of London, the area surrounding Burma Road was developed towards the end of the 19th century. A sale document in 1891 describes a 10-acre site with a sizeable residence and various surrounding dwellings; after the death of the then-owner, a Mr. Alexander, the land was sold and developed shortly afterwards. It illustrates the great change that came over Stoke Newington towards the turn of the century; originally called Grange Road, this was later changed to Burma Road. For more information, please see the History section.

The Grand Tour

A flight of stone steps leads to the main entrance; the stooped porch is surmounted by stuccoed columns, hailing back to the house's construction in the late 19th century. Ahead lies an elegant hallway which has been finished in 'Calke Green' by Farrow and Ball, while reclaimed teak floorboards run underfoot. To the right of the hall is an open plan kitchen and reception room; the voluminous space is filled with light from a vast bay window, which overlooks quiet Burma Road, to the front. An open fireplace has a wood-burning stove for cooler months.

To the rear is a large kitchen diner, with views over the garden. Designed by Roundhouse, the kitchen units are finished in an inky shade of blue, topped with stainless steel counters which are backed by slate subway tiles. The glazed French doors of the kitchen lead onto a sunny terrace with stairs to the lower patio and garden beyond. A WC and handy utility room complete the floor.

On the first floor, a large bedroom is currently used as a study and studio space, and has original stripped flooring. The sash windows run nearly the whole height of the wall. Adjacent is a handsome rear-facing bedroom with a 19th-century stove fireplace. The room leads out onto a terrace, which has reclaimed Moroccan cement floor tiles and a wooden canopy above. There is a bathroom on the half landing with bath, basin and WC.

The second floor is home to the primary bedroom suite, an expansive space comprising the bedroom, a walk-in wardrobe and a large en suite. The bedroom has been finished in a soothing olive green by Atelier Ellis and has painted timber flooring. The space is lit by two large sash windows, and an original fireplace provides a focal point to the room. To the rear of the bedroom is a large walk-in wardrobe and en suite bathroom. The en suite, with separate vanity and WC, is painted in plum brown, and Emery & Cie Moroccan cement tiles frame a bath.

On the top floor, a fourth bedroom is currently used as a studio space. With a wall of sliding glazing, the room leads on to a large private terrace, with a high vantage point that provides exceptional views over London. The room has been finished in clean white paint, with floorboards in 'Shaded White' by Farrow & Ball. There is a separate en suite with pale slate flooring, shower and WC.

The lower ground floor is home to a self-contained annexe flat. Accessed via a separate entrance to the front of the house, the annexe occupies the whole of the basement and comprises a kitchen diner, bedroom, study and bathroom. The kitchen diner, to the front of the house, is awash with natural light from an expansive bay window, which overlooks the small front garden. A bank of red kitchen units line one wall and the room has been finished in cool, neutral tones. A large bedroom overlooks the rear garden of the house, and a handy study or studio sits adjacent, with shower room between. The annexe has direct access to the rear garden.

The Great Outdoors

To the rear, a 60 sq ft, wonderfully private garden unfolds from the house. A Yorkstone patio, perfect for summer entertaining and al fresco dining, leads to the mature garden beyond. Partially shaded by a large olive tree, beds have been planted with poppies, hellebores and wallflowers for colour over the seasons. Brick-laid pathways lead around the flower beds to a large oak-framed workshop and potting shed at the rear, which has a tranquil secondary patio area.

Out and About

The house is wonderfully positioned just off historic Clissold Park and a short walk from Stoke Newington’s much-loved Church Street. Church Street is home to The Spence Bakery, Escocesa, Rubedo, AUN and The Good Egg, as well as many other independent businesses. Whole Foods Market and Newington Green Fruit and Vegetables are close by for a variety of fresh produce. The house is also within easy reach of the numerous independent shops, cafes, restaurants and pubs around Newington Green; The Clarence Tavern, Esters, Mangal 1, Jolene, Perilla and Cadet are particular neighbourhood favourites. A short walk away is Primeur; recently described as “the perfect neighbourhood restaurant,” it serves modern European cuisine and natural wine on nearby Petherton Road. On Saturday mornings, a farmers' market takes place in St Paul's churchyard on Stoke Newington High Street.

The house is also near several popular green spaces. Clissold Park – a compact park that packs a punch – is just off the house's doorstep. It’s home to an aviary, beautiful lakes, a café, tennis courts, a skate park, a children’s playground and paddling pool – as well as a few resident deer. Within the park is the Grade II-listed colonnaded Clissold Mansion, built in the 1790s for a local Quaker. Abney Park & Cemetery is about a 20-minute walk, and is one of the ‘Magnificent Seven’, an unofficial designation given to 19th-century private cemeteries in London. It is also a private nature reserve, with more than 2,500 varieties of plants.

For further adventures in nature, visit the Woodberry Wetlands, a 12-hectare conservation site, formerly a working reservoir, which is now a thriving habitat for migratory birds. Opened by Sir David Attenborough in 2016, you can see waterfowl, grey heron, tufted duck and kingfisher, among others, from the boardwalk around the East Reservoir, and enjoy spectacular views from the Coal House Café’s roof terrace. The West Reservoir of the wetlands has been converted into an outdoor swimming spot and sports centre, with year-round open-water swimming, sailing and kayaking.

Transport connections are excellent. Canonbury, a 15-minute walk away, runs overground trains to Highbury & Islington, Shoreditch High Street, Stratford, Camden and Hampstead. Dalston Kingsland and Dalston Junction overground are also within easy reach, while nearby Stoke Newington and Rectory Road stations are close by; both run overground services to Liverpool Street in around 10 minutes or Seven Sisters, for connections to the Underground, in around four minutes. There are plenty of good bus connections to the centre of the city, including to London Bridge, Victoria, Waterloo and Kings Cross.

Situated in the popular middle section of one of the area’s premier roads – a leafy location just off Wandsworth Common, close to excellent schools, transport facilities and both fashionable Northcote and Bellevue Roads.Hendrick Avenue is situated between Thurleigh Road and Nightingale Lane in this highly-sought after position adjacent to Wandsworth Common and its mainline station and provides substantial Victorian family houses (built circa 1885) with good gardens. This example has been thoughtfully designed at the rear with a lovely light and spacious conservatory extension off the stylish kitchen. The kitchen itself is attractively fitted with smart units including a large stainless steel sink unit, hob and oven and has built-in walnut breakfast bar. The extension is a considerable addition to the generous reception areas and connects via double doors to a magnificent double drawing room with oak floors and lovely original features including fireplace, cornices and doors. When compared to the double-fronted houses in the local area, (which often have two sets of narrower rooms) these extra-wide single-fronted late-Victorian houses typically have wider rooms and a greater sense of space and light as a result. The usual downside is no separate area for children to enjoy. But this is not the case here as there is a well-defined and snug TV room (or study) off the hall and kitchen. It’s separate enough to be able to shut out the noise but close enough to the main living spaces (with window into the kitchen) to keep both parents and children happy. There’s also a useful ground floor cloakroom/ WC and decent wood panelled cellar with plumbing for the laundry appliances.Upstairs the layout is again well thought out. The two rooms at the rear of the first floor have lovely views over the rear gardens and have been combined to create a delightful principal bedroom (with a wall of fitted wardrobes) and a beautifully appointed en suite bathroom. On the first floor to the front is another very large double bedroom with bay window, also with good fitted cupboards and an en suite shower room and which is therefore perfect for a nanny or for guests. The top floor provides three further double bedrooms and a family bathroom. There is also a generous storage loft. The garden is a delight; mainly lawned and with an easterly aspect. It is also especially open to the south which brings wonderful natural light into the kitchen area. At the same time there is an excellent feeling of seclusion from the rear with established climbers and neighbouring trees providing a lovely natural screen.Hendrick Avenue is positioned at the southern end of this highly popular area known locally as “Between the Commons”. With houses built only on one side it feels more open than other nearby streets and parking is without doubt less of an issue. It is convenient for good schools such as Northcote Lodge, Honeywell, Thomas’, Belleville, and Broomwood Hall as well as numerous local nurseries. Transport is excellent, with Clapham South tube (Northern Line) and Wandsworth Common BR stations very accessible. The green spaces of both Wandsworth are also very close by. The ever-increasing range of specialist shops, bar/ restaurants and thriving street market on nearby Northcote Road, has dramatically increased its popularity as a shopping parade in recent years and there is a further selection on Bellevue Road’s pretty parade. High-street convenience shopping including numerous supermarkets can be found at Clapham South and Clapham Junction.BrochuresBrochure 1"

As John Pardey so eloquently says; “We see our work as humanistic – modern, but tempered by a love of place, traditions and materials – we aim for timelessness in our buildings. We try hard to attain simplicity yet richness, clarity yet depth, elegance yet robustness”. Completed in 2008 and awarded a RIBA award in 2009. The Moorings is known by some locals as the “floating house”, elevated above ground, the approach to the house presents views through to the willows and river beyond as well as perfectly framing the house within its grounds. A steel staircase floats off the ground leading the way up to the covered entrance whereupon the front door opens into the entrance lobby. From here, glimpses of this magical setting are framed by Schucco sliding doors which open directly onto the elevated terrace. The centrally positioned lobby is the hinge that links the sense of effortless flow between the principal reception areas, bedrooms and gardens. The open plan reception areas display perfectly the thought behind the design ethos, where the ease with which one can move between the spaces of the discreet, bespoke kitchen, dining and sitting areas is seamless. With light filtering through from both sides and views over the front and rear riverside garden, this a delightful space to be. Sliding doors allow the raised terrace that runs along the rear of the property to become an extension to these reception areas and further seating or dining options are available from this elevated position to soak up the idyllic surroundings. At the far end of the room is a study with bespoke built in desk and mirror lined cabinetry. The design aesthetic of The Moorings creates a fluid and flexible living environment and this theme continues into the arrangement of the bedrooms. The house offers four bedrooms with ensuites and fabulous views onto eitheOutsideThe Moorings sits in private enclosed gardens approaching 1.02 acres, in an idyllic setting on the banks of the River Loddon which leads downstream to the River Thames. High sided mature hedging borders the gardens on either side with a sweeping drive leading to a parking area beneath the house which allows for multiple parking for several cars. The rear garden runs down to the water’s edge where a decked area and a riser mooring flanked on either side by two mature willow trees allow dappled light to fall on a charming area to dine, enjoy a drink or simply watch the river and its abundant life flow by.SituationThe Moorings is situated on the banks of the River Loddon in Wargrave, a highly regarded village with a strong community spirit. The yearly Wargrave Regatta is a highlight within the Wargrave calendar as is the biannual Wargrave Festival. Within the village you’ll find pubs/restaurants, chemist and grocery store. The property is within easy access of Wargrave train station which provides services via Twyford to Reading, London Paddington (Elizabeth Line) and Henley on Thames. A wider range of amenities and leisure activities are available in the nearby towns of Henley-on-Thames and Reading.

Constructed in the late 19th-century, the terrace has a handsome stuccoed façade and is complete with grand portico entrances, which in turn are flanked by Doric columns. This two bedroom apartment which unfolds over two floors and 1,315 sq ft, has a living area which sits on the piano nobile of the building, with wonderfully high ceilings and three balconies.

Setting the Scene

Queensberry Place forms the eastern boundary of the Queen's Gate conservation area and is notably quiet despite its remarkably central location. The street comprises three individually designed Victorian terraces that were built by William Douglas and one redbrick house. This terrace was built between 1867-8, and is four-storeys in height and wonderfully grand and ornamented. The windows to this floor are of the tripartite type, with French windows that open onto a narrow balcony enclosed with bottle balustrades. The Doric entrance porticos below are all finished with smart dentilled courses. For more information, please see the History section below.

The Grand Tour

Entry into the apartment is straight into a dining room. With high ceilings, the space is exceptionally voluminous. Painted a bold blue, it has bespoke, tall, bookshelves lining one wall. Through double doors is a light-filled drawing room. This time painted John Soane yellow; a colour researched and recreated when the drawing room at the Sir John Soane Museum was restored. This room has many of its original features, including intricate cornicing which crowns the room, as well as the original and ornate marble fireplace surround. Tall windows bring light into the room, whilst a pair of French doors open onto a balcony.

The rear of the apartment is home to a kitchen, where a large window frames views over its terrace, as well as backs of nearby houses. The kitchen itself comprises black cabinetry, set against Black Zimbawe stone worktops, whilst the walls are painted a bright red. Open shelves above the oven provide storage for pots and pans.

Steps ascend from this floor to the principal bedroom, with en suite bathroom. Here there are two balconies; one larger terrace accessed from the bathroom, and a balcony which sits behind a pair of French doors which open from the bedroom. The second bedroom sits on the floor below, currently used as a snug, it is also complete with en suite shower room, cleverly concealed behind a wallpapered door.

The Great Outdoors 

With three terraces, this apartment has access to numerous places to sit outside. The front balcony, which is east-facing, is perfect for morning coffee, whilst the rear outdoor spaces provide the perfect place from which to enjoy an evening cocktail. The rear terrace is framed by raised planters, stocked with plants from flowering pelargoniums to herbs.

Out and About

Renowned for its array of large detached plots, this tree lined street is seen as the 'dream spot' for many looking to upsize.

Aaron (Devenports Co-Owner)Entering the marketplace for the first time in almost 50 years, this four double bedroom detached house is something to marvel at itself with its showpiece kitchen entertaining space and plethora of original features. It is the opportunity at hand though which we at Devenports think will really excite buyers. With a width measuring over 78 feet and with what seems like endless possibilities for extension whether considering a loft, double side or further extension this property displays all the hallmarks of potentially being the largest and most valuable home in the street, should the correct investment be applied, an opportunity which is somewhat priceless.Still looking for more?

Built in 1928 within the Coxhill Green Estate, Greenacre sits nestled in a heavenly plot of circa 0.75 acres. Beautifully planted gardens with a log cabin lend colour throughout the seasons, while inside a prodigious layout of 4467sq ft has ample capacity to create a self-contained ground floor bedroom suite. Impeccably presented with a refined sense of style, a wealth of reception rooms open onto the terracing at every opportunity, while integral garaging and a sweeping gravel driveway supply ample off-road parking. Instantly evoking all the elegance and charm you could hope for a period property, Greenacre sits peacefully back from the leafy foliage of Philpot Lane behind a sweeping gravel driveway framed by graceful gardens stretching out beneath the dappled shade of statuesque Scots Pine trees. Utterly enticing, the steeped roofs, red brick and bow windows of its double fronted facade conjure a picture perfect first impression while inside an exemplary two storey layout offers a quiet sense of luxury. Built in 1928 on the Coxhill Green Estate it has been home to the same family for the past 33 years. Extended and enhanced over the years, its versatile arrangement has enabled the running of businesses from home over those years. Today Greenacre proffers an exceptional degree of flexibility to cater to your own lifestyle needs with potential options for a second entrance and self-contained accommodation.Step in from the canopied doorway and you’ll discover a central entrance hall with a turning staircase. Natural light tumbles in from classically tall windows, while the warming tones of Ted Todd wood floors and a soft heritage palette guide you through a wonderfully free flowing layout. French doors in each and every one of the rooms to the rear of the house open out onto a tremendous York stone terrace allowing daily life to feel connected with the gardens at every opportunity. Two refined reception rooms each have focal point fireplaces and while one is a notable family room, the other reaches out over double aspect dimensions opening into a large luxury wetroom to give you the option of having a ground floor bedroom suite for adapted living. Equally impressive, a generously sized contemporary office/dining room is fitted with Vitsoe units. Supremely well appointed, the kitchen/breakfast room continues the elegantly understated aesthetics proffering plentiful space for everyone to spend time together while you cook and catch up on the day’s events. Designed by the renowned Orchard Kitchens in Egham, its painted Shaker cabinetry and sleek countertops house an array of integrated Neff appliances. A matching central island delineates the space and while further French doors make al fresco dining easy, the impeccable adjoining conservatory leads the way to a stunning triple aspect drawing/garden room with a magnificent vaulted timber ceiling. This is a versatile space and could also be used as an office or consulting room, since there is access via the conservatory to a pathway leading to the front of the house. A utility room and two cloakrooms complete the ground floor. Upstairs the tastefully chosen heritage hues are echoed in each of the six double bedrooms. Looking out over the rear garden a superb principal bedroom has a fitted David James dressing room and a simply enviable luxury en suite bathroom with an inset double ended bathtub and wetroom shower. Two further bedrooms have deluxe en suite shower rooms, whilst the sixth is a study/bedroom with Vitsoe fittings and Ted Todd wood floor to match the office below. Sympathetically styled to reflect the history of the house, the traditional suite of the spacious family bathroom is arranged in a rich navy blue wood panelled setting that adds a charming finishing touch. Generating a breathtaking backdrop to the house, the westerly-facing rear gardens of Greenacre wrap-around to produce an incredibly special place to escape from the world outside. A reclaimed York stone terrace is a discerning destination for al fresco entertaining and equally ideal to just simply sit back and admire your surroundings. Beautifully planted, a considered collection of daffodils, camellia, azaleas and cherry blossom combine with cottage garden flowers such as peonies and crocosmia and evergreen trees to add colour and greenery throughout each and every season. This quintessential English country garden is a joy to experience. Encompassed by high hedging giving a cherished level of privacy, a considerable lawn gives you every excuse to take a stroll to the ‘Norfolk’ log cabin by Creative Living and sit with a glass of wine on its patio. To the front of this Chobham home you’ll notice that the drive is lined by cobbles reclaimed from the former Harrods depository in Barnes. The integral garaging has a lift that makes life easy for everyone but could be replaced by stairs if needed, and together with the driveway supplies off-road parking for numerous vehicles.

The property boasts generously sized rooms with tall ceilings, providing ample and versatile living space. It comprises four spacious reception rooms, including a substantial reception area adjoining the utility space at the back of the house. This portion could be developed into an independent annexe, featuring an external entrance (subject to obtaining the necessary planning approvals).

This hallway grants access to three expansive reception rooms and the kitchen/breakfast room located at the rear, overlooking the gardens. Connected to the kitchen is a sizeable utility room, a bathroom, and a rear reception space, which has the potential to function as a self-contained annexe. The first floor accommodates four generous bedrooms, three of which have en-suite facilities. Stairs lead to the second floor, where four additional bedrooms and a shower room are situated.

DescriptionWarlies Gardens stands adjacent to the mansion and parkland estate at Warlies Park House, a grade II listed building dating back to the late 18th Century. The property was used as the head gardener's cottage and laundry for the Warlies Estate.Warlies Gardens was acquired by a private owner in 1932 and from that date onwards, the house was used as a single dwelling.The Warlies Estate has a fascinating past; in 1851, the estate was sold to Sir Edward North Buxton, 2nd Baronet, whereupon the estate entered what was perhaps its most illustrious historic period under the ownership of the Buxton family. Sir Edward’s father was philanthropist Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, 1st Baronet, whose important work in the abolition of slavery in the British dominions is commemorated on the Bank of England's £5 note. The Estate remained with the Buxton Family until 1928 when it was then sold to Dr. Barnardo in 1928 who opened a home for 53 girls aged between 15 - 30 who were certified ‘mentally defective’ and therefore unable to take up normal work. Despite the care of the mentally deficient being little understood in those days, the physical care of the children in Banardo’s home was considered ahead of its time and reports indicate that the children were educated in health and hygiene “above their class”.The ground floor accommodation comprises; a very spacious entrance reception with stairs to the first floor, a good sized office and WC, a bright and superb drawing room with high ceilings, feature fireplace and large windows, a beautiful dining room with bay window and that leads into a pretty orangery, a downstairs shower room and WC, a well appointed kitchen breakfast room and a lovely rear reception room with bay window and pretty views of the garden.The First Floor accommodation comprises; four generous bedrooms, a family bathroom and WC. OutsideThe property is accessed via a private road to Warlies Park House. There are two separate entrances to the drive allowing for an ‘in out’ arrangement if desired. There is a gardeners bothy which has an active planning permission to provide a one bedroom annex and two further outbuildings which offer a fantastic opportunity to convert into a flexible space depending on a buyers specific requirements. To the rear is a magnificent garden of about 300’ in length with many mature trees, an expansive area laid to lawn, an orchard and pretty pond. The views of the countryside beyond the boundary are spectacular and include a beautiful temple on the brow of one of the hills.  To the southern elevation on the right hand side of the house is an additional and stunning walled area and would have been part of the walled gardens to the Mansion. For the garden enthusiast one could imagine this section becoming a more formal part of the garden allowing for a ‘show garden’ or perhaps a maze for the younger occupants/visitors. The total plot is about 1.83 acres and is divided up into lots of different areas of interest.LocationUpshire is a delightful village located near to Epping and Waltham Abbey. Epping, an old market town has an excellent choice of local independent and boutique shops together with a Tesco and Marks and Spencer and is about 4.3 miles away. The Central Line rail service runs from Epping to London Liverpool Street  making it ideal for the city commuter.  There are a great selection of schools in the surrounding areas both at state and private entry. For the commuter there is good access to the M11 and M25.The ancient woodland of Epping Forest is on almost on your doorstop offering a vast array for outdoor activities including it's network of over 100 miles of bridleways.The Horsehoes pub is 0.7 of a mile away and is a popular country pub serving gastro good and popular for it's Sunday roasts.Square Footage: 3,076 sq ft

No corners have been cut in the renovation and each room is as beautifully appointed as the next. The wrap around garden has been landscaped, and its corner plot ensures each generous room is filled with natural light from the south and west. With three linked reception rooms, the ground floor offers versatile space for both family time and sophisticated entertaining which can spill outside during the summer months. Upstairs, all five bedrooms are double, spread over two storeys, sharing three elegant bathrooms. Its proximity to several popular schools, the clean and quiet beaches of Hove, beautiful parks and the South Downs, plus the A23/A27 and Hove Station, mean this house would be desirable to families and professionals looking to live in comfort and luxury in by the coast.
Style: Semi-detached Edwardian villaType: 5 double bedrooms, 3 bathrooms + 1 WC, 3 reception rooms, 1 kitchen Location: Pembroke & Princes Conservation AreaFloor Area: 2900 sq ftOutside: Wrap around south and west facing gardenParking: Off-road parking for 1 carCouncil Tax Band: GWhy you’ll like it:Set well back from the road behind boundary walls and structural planting, this Edwardian villa is both beautiful and imposing. Built in 1899, this house was always intended as a grand residence which would balance home comforts with a luxurious lifestyle. The exquisite architectural detailing and ornate period features both inside and out were certainly set to impress. Now over 120 years later, they have been brought back to their original grandeur, to last for many years to come. The scale and beauty of the house become apparent as you step inside the grand front door and vestibule. The original character of the house shines through in the welcoming entrance hall where natural light filters down the stairwell. Restored and reinstated period features are plentiful and the ceilings soar, decorated with classic cornicing and roses. New engineered oak flooring runs throughout the ground floor and it is clear the current owners have a refined eye for interiors. Sitting Rooms:The first reception to the right is the formal sitting room; looking out over the front garden to the south via a wide bay sash window. Taking centre stage, a cast iron open fireplace adds warmth and atmosphere to wintery evenings, or new column radiators are also in place for when time is of the essence. A soothing cool palette has been used throughout and the space feels both spacious and homely with room for generous furnishings so the whole family can come together in the evening. A double opening leads through to the kitchen and dining room, although these rooms can also remain separate using sliding timber doors – ideal for families with older children who may wish to entertain independently on occasion. Mirroring the first living room, the second sitting room also benefits from a wide bay sash window and is a versatile space which would be ideal as a sizable home office, TV snug or playroom, depending on need.Kitchen & Dining Room:This outstanding kitchen was created by opening two rooms to create one, large open plan space with a vast, Corian-topped central island and stylish dark cabinetry offering plenty of storage solutions. There is space to sit and socialise at the breakfast bar, or on comfortable furnishings elsewhere, and a third reception room sits open to the room as a formal dining area. Once again, timber doors can be used to separate these spaces, but they give the ground floor a lovely sense of flow when they are open. Within the kitchen units, the dishwasher is fully integrated, while space has been left for a Rangemaster cooker and a tall fridge freezer (both may be available by separate negotiation). Nearby, the utility room has space for a washer dryer and houses the new gas central heating and eco water heating cylinders.The Garden & Drive:Offering more space than many city gardens, this one has been cleverly designed to include seating areas bordered by a row of pleached trees for complete privacy. Faux grass is ideal for ball games without traipsing mud through the house during wet weather, and two decked areas catch the sun at different times of the day for alfresco dining. To the front and side of the house, scented lavender and olive trees form a lovely backdrop from inside, and the shingle driveway has space for one large car alongside an electric car-charging point. First Floor Bedrooms & Bathroom:Herringbone carpet rises up the stairs to a generous landing from which three king size bedrooms reside. Soft, restful tones adorn the walls and woodwork which have been paired with walnut engineered wood flooring which brings both form and function to each space. All three rooms have five-sash bay windows looking out to the mature trees on the crescent, and facing both west and south, warm light filters in during the afternoon. There is ample space in each for king beds and freestanding furnishings without compromising on space, and bedrooms one and two are linked by a dressing room which would also be ideal as a nursery for new parents – or a peaceful home office for working from home. While bedroom one has an en suite bathroom, bedrooms two and three share use of the family bathroom which has a modern take on a period style with traditional fittings and metro brick wall tiles around the shower and bath. Principal Bedroom Suite: Bedroom one is the principal room which boasts a chic and stylish en suite bathroom with matt white dual basins, an organically curved freestanding bathtub and matt-black accessories to include floor mounted taps and a rainfall shower within the separate cubicle. There is a further dressing room, and the romantic original features continue into every room on the first floor with deep skirtings, original internal doors and cast-iron fireplaces.Second floor bedrooms:Bedrooms four and five are built within loft space which gives them vaulted ceilings and dormer windows, yet in a house of such scale, the headroom is not compromised in the slightest. Both have a great deal of walk-in storage and their windows frame views over the local landscape under open skies. These are ultimately tranquil rooms due to their elevation in the house, and once again, they could have any number of uses. They share use of the third bathroom which is in keeping with those on the first floor for both style, fittings and modern appeal. Agent’s thoughts:This is a house which needs to be seen to be fully appreciated. The incredible respect the current owners have for the character of the house is breath-taking, and it is clear no corners have been cut in its creation. It is such a pleasure to see a house of such scale brought back to its original splendour – yet with the modern additions of electric car charging port and eco central and water heating. Owners’ thoughts:“We were bowled over by the scale and beauty of this house and feel honoured to have been the ones to breathe new life into it. It is an incredible family home and we have enjoyed every inch of it – entertaining friends and just spending time together, and we cannot fault the location. Our son’s school St Christophers is just 3-minutes away, so hugely convenient, and there is so much nearby to entertain children with the beach and Hove Lawns on your doorstep.

Walk just four minutes to Ladywell Station, or 11 to Lewisham Station. You are also just a few minutes from wonderful local green spaces: Hilly Fields and Ladywell Fields. 

You have a charging point serving your driveway. In the main front door and from your hall, a delightful formal 'grown up' front reception room rests to your right - of over 14 feet by over 11 feet, with a beautiful fireplace and bespoke window shutters. 

An independent utility room and generous w.c. also feature to this floor, as well as a flexible room for games/media/home working/consultation/yoga - you choose! The separate entrance leaves so many options open. There's lots of built-in storage here too. 

The main event is at the rear of the house: the huge open-plan reception/kitchen/dining room - of over 24 feet by over 20 feet, with polished concrete floor, central island and huge roof lights. You'll enjoy oodles of square feet day to day yourselves, and when you host a party! The timeless designer (Häcker) fitted kitchen offers loads of storage and worktop space, and integrated Siemens appliances (including an induction hob). Folding doors span the width of the house and deliver you to the big and low-maintenance garden - where you can bask in loads of afternoon sun. 

Up to the half-landing and you have the main (windowed) bathroom to your right, then your first double bedroom is straight ahead (of over 10 feet by 9 feet, with a built-in wardrobe). 

From the main landing, you have a big master bedroom to the front of the house (of over 16 feet by over 12 feet), a third double bedroom (of over 10 feet by over 9 feet), and another dual-aspect suite-style bedroom, with private en suite shower room. 

On the second floor, you'll find a large fifth bedroom in the former loft space - with Velux windows (one regular and one balcony), as well as generous accessible eaves storage. 

Your local high street area is in Ladywell. Here the offerings include a lovely deli (The Larder), a good butcher (Meat Jon) and a Mamma Dough (for great sourdough pizzas). A new 40-seat modern-European restaurant is joining the list this year (in the old Coral shop). 

Also local, Loampit Hill has a fair bit going on these days - Middleton coffee shop/deli is a good spot for fantastic local coffee, pastries and brunches, and check out Chicha (serving vibrant Peruvian street food) and The Talbot pub. And don't miss Brockley Market - a foodie Saturday one held in Lewisham College's walled car park. 

Brockley (walk here within 20 minutes) has nice independent restaurants such as Tai and L'Oculto Cocina and cool bars: Brickfields, Joyce, and Brockley Brewery (with taproom) of course. 

The Deptford High Street area including Deptford Market Yard is very hip - with bars, night spots, cafes, restaurants and breweries. We particularly rate Salt, Marcella, Isla Ray's, Stockton and Villages.

And central New Cross is close. Our top tips here include the contemporary art gallery: Goldsmiths CCA, and Meze Mangal for the best Turkish grub. 

Central Lewisham's handy for mall shopping and markets. You've also got the best fish and chip shop in London (we think!). 

Green space? Stroll to Hilly Fields and Ladywell Fields in mere minutes, or walk around half an hour for Greenwich Royal Park.

Local schools include Prendergast Ladywell Primary and Secondary Schools, and Lewisham TLG Primary."

The Coach House is the most wonderful family home in a delightful setting. The Coach House and Spring Cottage are both approached down a private drive, the first part of which is shared with a neighbour. There is plenty of parking in the courtyard in front of the house for five or more vehicles. Off the courtyard are two single garages; one attached to the house (with an inspection pit and workbench to the rear) and the other detached. The Victorian proportions create light and spacious accommodation. The attached garage could be brought into the accommodation to extend the house further, subject to gaining the necessary consents. The property is not Listed.  The walled garden offers exciting development opportunities (Subject To Planning) and flexibility as it has its own title deeds and its own access and services rights.  The front door leads into a hallway off which are the utility room, cloakroom with a downstairs shower, kitchen and sitting room. The farmhouse-style kitchen forms the central hub to the home and has a lovely cosy feel. It has a four-oven, oil-fired AGA and an arch that leads through to the dining area. French doors lead from the dining area into a charming courtyard garden. The sitting room has a wood burner and provides access into the kitchen, study and drawing room. The 25' drawing room is particularly special and has an open Rayburn fireplace at one end, and French doors leading out to a second courtyard garden. The study could be used as a fifth bedroom and could use the shower/cloakroom off the hallway.Stairs from the sitting room lead up to the first floor landing and corridor, off which are four bedrooms, a family bathroom and a separate WC. The principal bedroom has an en suite bathroom. Three of the four bedrooms overlook the lovely walled garden.The 100-year-old walled garden offers the most wonderful tranquillity and privacy for a family. The walls provide shelter for the outdoor swimming pool and wide variety of specimen shrubs and fruit trees. Beside the pool is an original glasshouse that takes advantage of the southerly aspect with a prolific grapevine trained across the roof. In former times, the glasshouse  would have provided soft fruit for the neighbouring Loddon Court and, with some renovation, could again be extremely productive. There is also a workshop, a store and two wells.Accessed off the kitchen/dining area and the drawing room are a series of three very pretty, linked walled gardens which are mainly laid to lawn, with shrubs, bushes and flower borders. A gate leads into the main walled garden.Off the main courtyard there is a gate that leads to a paddock with post and rail fencing, within which is a field shelter and tack room, an additional well and original pump handle.Lot 2 – Spring Cottage.  Spring Cottage is thought to have been the Grooms accommodation to the neighbouring property, Loddon Court. It is attached to The Coach House and an internal door, currently double-locked and sound-proofed, could bring the two homes into one on the ground floor.Spring Cottage shares the same driveway as The Coach House and has its own separate private parking area for several vehicles beside the front garden and in front of the detached single garage. The front garden is delightful and has a grass lawn and an ornamental pond.On the ground floor there is a bright, L-shaped sitting room and a separate dining room or study. The kitchen overlooks the front garden and there is a ground floor cloakroom.Upstairs, the principal bedroom has an en suite shower room and there are two further bedrooms and a family bathroom.To the rear of the cottage is a small south-facing walled courtyard that is accessed through the cottage through French door.Reading 5 miles, Basingstoke 13.5 miles, Newbury 20 miles, London 41 miles, M4 (J11) 2.8 miles, London Paddington via Reading station 26 minutes, Heathrow 30 miles (All distances and times are approximate)The property is situated in a rural position on the outskirts of Swallowfield (mentioned in the Doomsday Book) just to the south of Reading.

The nearby centres of Reading, Wokingham and Basingstoke are all within easy daily reach and provide a broader range of shopping, recreational and educational facilities.Communications in the area are first-class with the M3 and M4 motorways a short drive away. There are mainline stations at Reading – recently opened Crossrail giving access to Canary Wharf in 59 minutes. Mortimer station giving access to Reading or Basingstoke is just 4 miles away. Wokingham to London Waterloo providing fast and regular services.There are a number of excellent state and private schools within the area, including Daneshill, St Neots, Wellington College, Lord Wandsworth College, Bradfield College and Pangbourne.

The communal reception lounge with concierge desk also provides  access to lavishly-stocked south-east facing gardens. The passenger lift behind the reception lounge provides access to this first-floor apartment. The property has been fully refurbished to an extremely high standard, with no expense spared.

SELLER'S INSIGHT“We so enjoy the convenience and tranquillity of living at 68 Vincent Square, Westminster. A daily pleasure for us is the uninterrupted view of the private playing fields in Vincent Square immediately opposite our living room windows and terrace. This view provides a truly calming effect – we could be almost anywhere!  On a summer afternoon the leaves filter the strength of the sun while the occasional ‘clunk' of leather on willow suggests we may still be in England. During the winter months the lack of leaves gives us an even better view of the entire square. The astro-turf tennis courts – available to Vincent Square residents out of school hours and for a small annual subscription – are a much-valued local facility.  For our grand-children, an annual highlight is a glimpse of the New Year's Eve fireworks over the River Thames in front of the London Eye.   The convenience of living in this part of Westminster prompted us a few years ago to go ‘car-free'. All our regular shopping needs, restaurants and entertainment venues are within a short walk, while there are always plenty of cabs in the vicinity.” ** These comments are the personal views of the current owners and are included as an insight into life at the property. They have not been independently verified and do not necessarily reflect the views of the selling agent.STEP OUTSIDE Local Amenities Vincent Square: A most welcome and much appreciated area (13 acres/5 hectares) of green space.
