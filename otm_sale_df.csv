Additionally, there are numerous children's activities and community groups to cater to the needs of young families.Sellers Thoughts:""We have loved living here on Hampden Road. Our neighbours are wonderful, and there is a strong sense of community on the road. Our best times have been in our flat. The lounge is the perfect size for hosting friends and family (which we frequently do) or for relaxing and unwinding in the evenings. With a separate dining space, it’s not only ideal for dinner parties but also provides the flat with ample social and relaxation areas.The garden is our favourite space, with two seating areas (a coffee table space with a patio and an L-shaped sofa). We thoroughly enjoy dining, drinking, and socialising outdoors here. Surprisingly, the garden remains tranquil despite its proximity to various roads and shops. Moreover, there is plenty of room for pets to roam, or, as we’ve attempted several times (not always successfully), to cultivate beautiful plants.In terms of location, we are a short walk away from Crouch End and the Ladder, both of which offer numerous pubs, bars, and restaurants that we cherish, all conveniently close to our flat.We have loved it here and we are sure whoever the next owner is, will love it too.""Please contact the Sales department at Winkworth Harringay office to arrange an appointment to view[use Contact Agent Button] - [use Contact Agent Button]                   Winkworth.co.uk  Your local independently owned property agency with a network of 60 London offices.

Arranged over five light-filled levels, the internal accommodation unfolds over 2,800 sq ft and five bedrooms. A charming south-facing private garden opens seamlessly from the lower-ground floor living spaces, culminating with a brilliant ancillary garden studio. Contemporary interventions in the house echo elements of the past and blend beautifully with the original plan; the interiors were recently reimagined by acclaimed conservation architecture practice Arts Lettres. The home is minutes from Tufnell Park underground station and Fortess Road, with its array of independent provisors, while the delights of Hampstead Heath are just a 15-minute walk away.

Setting the Scene

Five storeys high and three bays wide, the houses on Ospringe Road have a simple yet dignified appearance. They are built from London stock brick and have tall chimney stacks projecting from steep Welsh slate roofs. The terraces on each side of the road are defined by canted bays, beautiful arched windows on the raised ground floor, and pronounced wide set open porches featuring brick cornicing and stucco dressings.

This home had an extensive renovation in recent years, overhauling all utilities and architectural components and an entire refurbishment of the interior spaces to a wonderfully high standard. Historic features have been carefully preserved, including fine plasterwork and an elegant, sculptural staircase. For more information, please see the History section.

The Grand Tour

The house is set back from the road behind a low brick wall and laurel hedge. A mature fig tree sits proudly in the front garden, from where steps ascend to the main deep-set entrance porch; a further separate door is on the lower-ground floor. The original front door is four-panelled, painted lead grey and inset with etched glass. An arched transom light rests above, and both floors’ entrance doors feature Banham stainless steel security locks. The home also has a fully working alarm system.

The entrance hall’s expansive walls are painted in the rich ‘Hague Blue’ by Farrow and Ball. As part of the imaginative restoration of the house, the original floorboards were painted white and relaid diagonally, lending an almost Scandinavian air to the raised ground floor spaces, complemented by original plasterwork that frames the elevations.

The bipartite living room is some 30 ft deep with wide-set wedding doors positioned centrally, making both spaces more intimate if required. Large windows at either end allow the spaces to be flooded with light. The front part of the room functions as a reading room. Painted in ‘Vardo’ by Farrow and Ball, a deep teal colour, it has custom-built floor-to-ceiling bookcases creating an enveloping space. The back of the room is a traditional sitting room with French windows opening to a Juliet balcony overlooking the garden and climbing vines winding through the balustrade, lending a wonderful sense of romance to the immediate aspect. Walls here are painted in the soft blush-coloured ‘Pink Ground’, also by Farrow and Ball, making the most of the southerly light.

The lower-ground floor rooms have been opened to create one large, convivial kitchen, dining and sitting room. The room has excellent ceiling heights and encaustic tile flooring laid in a pattern with varying shades of dark grey. The entire floor is warmed with underfloor heating; two doors open from here to the garden.

The kitchen is positioned at the front of the plan, with a large elongated island unit positioned centrally. Custom designed, cupboards are faced in horizontal planks of wood, and a double butler sink is inset. Off-white tiles act as the worksurface. A wall of pine shelves is complemented by a white-painted base cupboards underneath. The cooking and prep station is positioned along the opposite wall, with a run of floor cabinets featuring similar horizontal plank wood-faced drawers with stainless steel atop. A large Mercury steel range cooker and freestanding stainless steel fridge freezer also feature. A large utility room is positioned under the stoop, with room for a washer and dryer. This space also acts as a boiler room for the house.

The first floor is home to the main bedroom suite, with the sleeping quarters papered in an elegant hand-pressed linocut block print design. A cleverly designed jib door opens to a large walk-in wardrobe; a second opens to the en suite. A reclaimed cast-iron bath is set beside the window, and the room has a separate shower enclosure. A further secondary bedroom is positioned to the rear of this floor.

The second floor has two additional large bedrooms, currently used as home offices and studio spaces. The rear room also has what is currently used as a large storage cupboard with a window, but could make for a brilliant additional en suite with plumbing already in place. French windows from this rear room open to a further balcony and its southerly views. Both these rooms share a large bathroom with David Hicks-designed wallpaper and an additional roll-top bath.

The sculptural staircase continues its ascent to the uppermost floor; the stairwell is lit from above by a large square skylight. Currently given over entirely to a guest bedroom, the room has plentiful storage set deep into the eaves. Large glass doors open to a third spacious balcony with exceptional 180-degree views of London and, on a clear day, as far as the Sussex Downs.

The Great Outdoors

The south-facing garden opens from the lower-ground floor to a seating terrace. Here, a clever brick paving design has been laid beside large, honed pale stone flags. Grapevines and climbing roses wind their way along the rear elevation. Established planting includes jasmine, English roses and buddleia, attracting a wonderful array of bees, birds and butterflies.

Raised beds surround the lawn, with a York stone pathway leading to the ancillary garden studio. Built specifically as a daylight photographic studio, though easily used for other purposes, including a home office, the structure is partially sunk into the garden below ground level, allowing for dramatic ceiling heights internally. The lead mono-pitch roof is inset with a large glass aperture, with another full-height glass window set into the north elevation, facing the main house. Both these architectural interventions allow an excellent quality of light into the studio space, which is painted a dark grey and has a poured concrete floor. Arts Lettres also designed this space, and it replicates the northern daylight lighting of the late acclaimed American photographer Irving Penn.

Out and About

Ospringe Road is close to a diverse range of local shopping facilities, including the aforementioned shops on Fortess Road and fishmonger Jonathan Norris, butchers Meat NW5 and Tufnell Park Bakery. There is a fantastic wine shop, Theatre of Wine, on Junction Road, opposite The Tiffin Tin, which is often cited as the best Indian takeaway in north London. Kentish Town has numerous independent shops, delis and pubs, including The Southampton Arms, The Pineapple and the Bull and Last in nearby Dartmouth Park. Islington, Highbury Fields and Highbury Barn are easily accessible to the south, while Highgate, Swain’s Lane are to the north. Local green spaces include Hampstead Heath and more locally, Dalmeny Park and Montpelier Gardens

The house is within the catchment for some of North London’s most sought-after primary schools, Eleanor Palmer and Torriano (both Ofsted ‘Outstanding’), and the much-respected Acland Burghley, Parliament Hill and Camden School for Girls secondary schools. There is also an excellent choice of local independent schools nearby, including North Bridge House, Highgate School and Channing School. Local pre-schools include Montpelier Nursery and the Montessori Rainbow Nursery.

Transport links are excellent, with the house equidistant to Kentish Town and Tufnell Park Underground stations (Northern Line & City Thameslink). Regular buses also run to both The City and West End.

Built in 1880 in the high Victorian style, the home has exquisite proportions, with four bedrooms, a capacious double-height living space, and a dramatic 35-foot-deep double-height principal bedroom suite across the entire uppermost storey. The interior spaces are arranged around over 3,800 sq ft of highly versatile accommodation. As a former artist’s studio, the quality of light throughout is exceptional, thanks to unusually expansive fenestration in most rooms. Additionally, there is a private west-facing garden and parking space for two vehicles. The home is moments from the excellent conveniences of Belsize Village, Primrose Hill, and Hampstead.

Setting the Scene

Wychcombe Studios were built in the 1880s as part of the wider area’s 19th-century development. They are located in the northernmost section of the Eton conservation area. At various times, the studios have been home to artists, including Robert Macbeth, Arthur Rackham, and Charles Orchardson. Orchardson lived in this studio from 1903 to 1904. The studios are believed to have been designed by the noted Victorian architecture practice Batterbury and Huxley, who also designed several grand homes on neighbouring streets. For more information, please see the History section.

The Grand Tour

A private driveway leads southward from England’s Lane, culminating in a tall black metal electronic gate. The gate gives few clues to the remarkable homes that lie beyond. The gate opens to a large carriage driveway and beautiful communal gardens. This home is in the southwest corner of the enclave, with two parking spaces positioned on the cobbled area just outside the house.

The house was originally two separate buildings but has now been unified. The main elevation is remarkable, with white-painted brickwork inset with a soaring arched double-height window at the northern range. An expanse of a dozen further windows is set above, running the entire width of the home and crowning the structure.

The entrance is through a roundhead doorway with red brick dressings. The main hall has dark-stained pine floorboards underfoot. The hall is adjacent to the living room, a dramatic square-set space with double-height ceilings. The soaring roundhead window set into the east elevation floods the room with light. A Carrara marble chimneypiece acts as a focal point and grounds the room, housing an open fire. An open staircase ascends from the living room to the first floor, with a spacious mezzanine landing set above.

The kitchen opens from the rear of the living room. It has an expanse of six windows and further sliding glass doors opening to the garden. The kitchen has wood veneer cabinetry with stainless steel countertops at one end, and there is plentiful space for informal dining at the other.

Also on the ground floor is a guest bedroom with an en suite shower room that opens directly to the garden, a separate study, and a further guest WC. A secondary staircase leads to the bedrooms above. The first floor has two bedrooms. The rear bedroom has its own en suite shower room, while the second bedroom at the front of the plan enjoys sole use of the adjacent spacious bathroom.

The second floor is home to the principal bedroom suite. This was originally the main artist’s studio and is an exceptional space, with an open pitch set into the double-height roof. An expanse of tall windows is set into the entire east and west elevations. Steel beams are left exposed, and there is an open limestone-clad hearth and working fire. A bespoke armoire at the end of the room cleverly conceals a smart kitchenette for convenience. A mezzanine level is set above the vast space, which can be used as further sleeping quarters. It has its own en suite shower room.

A bank of fitted wardrobes and a dressing area are positioned to the rear of the principal bedroom space and lead to an en suite bathroom. This is an excellently conceived room, wonderfully light, with half the ceiling formed with panes of glass. Slate tiles run underfoot, and there is a vanity set into a canted bay with two sinks atop. Additionally, there is a spacious shower area and a separate white resin bateau bathtub.

The Great Outdoors

The west-facing garden is a brilliant outdoor space that is incredibly private. It opens from both the guest bedroom and kitchen on the ground floor, and there is also additional side access. The garden is spanned by a flagstone terrace that has plenty of space for outdoor furniture. Steps descend to a verdant lawn and raised beds with mature shrubs. A pergola is positioned to one side.

The mature Poplar trees and bamboo surrounding the garden create a sense of privacy and tranquillity. This is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the outdoors.

Out and About

Wychcombe Studios is located close to the shops and cafes of Haverstock Hill, Belsize Park Village, and Hampstead Village. Nearby amenities include Gail’s bakery, England’s Lane café, and numerous pubs and restaurants.

Primrose Hill and the beautiful Regent’s Park are a short walk to the south; Hampstead Heath is also within walking distance of the home, offering freshwater swimming year-round in the men’s and ladies Bathing Ponds, as well as some of London’s most beautiful woodland walks. In addition to elevated views of the city from Parliament Hill, there are tennis courts, cafes and Kenwood House, a wonderful 17th-century country house and gallery.

The house is within walking distance of several independent day schools, including the Hall, St Antony’s, South Hampstead High School, St Christopher’s, Trevor Roberts and Sarum Hall.

Belsize Park (Northern Line) and Swiss Cottage (Jubilee Line) underground stations are within easy reach, and there are multiple bus routes to central London from Haverstock Hill. Kings Cross Station is a short tube journey away, providing railway connections nationwide and served by Hammersmith & City, Circle, Victoria, Northern, Piccadilly and Metropolitan Underground lines, while St Pancras International Station provides Eurostar connections to Paris and Brussels.

This extra space is also created on the garden level with a large utility room with access onto the patio and garden.The garden level provides for a spacious open plan kitchen and informal dining area with the added convenience of direct access from street level and the parking area. Across the upper floors there are five spacious bedrooms, a family bathroom, and the principal suite which includes extensive wardrobes, a well appointed ensuite bathroom and views over the garden and beyond.The patio and the mature and manicured rear garden is a particular feature of this house being significantly wider and deeper than the average. Due to the superb position of the plot with neighbouring gardens abutting, a garden square effect is created giving a sense of green open space to the rear of the house.There is existing planning permission to build above the garage and add approximately 500 square foot to the current foot print.LocationThe house is conveniently situated within just a few hundred yards of both Richmond town centre (with its sophisticated yet charming shops and restaurants) and train station, the latter of which provides a rapid overland service direct into London Waterloo, as well as the District Line tube and overland to Stratford, via north London. Local schools enjoy an excellent reputation and are considered amongst the best in the country. Richmond Park and a particularly scenic stretch of the River Thames are nearby and provide an ideal retreat from the hubbub of daily life.Square Footage: 2,871 sq ft

It was perfected by the Venetians, with some of the finest examples being the Palazzo Ducale, Ca’ d’Oro and the Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti.   Lothbury was designed by the celebrated RIBA architect George Somers Clarke in the late 1860’s who also worked on the designs for the Palace of Westminster. Once completed it became the head office for the General Credit and Discount Company, later the home of brokers and merchants Speyer Brothers, The National Bank of Australia, stockbrokers Laurie Milbank & Co and a private dining club for the Overseas Bankers’ Club.  Converted into luxury apartments this millennium by Marldon, the building was restored to its former glory, designed to complement the building’s heritage and using thoughtful architecture and contemporary finishes to create the perfect space for City living.  The apartment is certainly “grand”. The living area is almost palatial with a ceiling height of just under 5 metres, ornate cornicing and five super large sash windows. This space is cleverly adapted to create a comfortable living, dining area and study space.

""I love the community feel we’ve built up with the neighbours you don’t need to be In Each other’s pockets but you know if you need anything they’re there to help. It feels safe.
I love being so close to the parks and green space on the doorstep as well as walking distance to shops.
Kew is also on the doorstep - another little bit of heaven and my happy place. Chiswick Richmond, and Kingston are not too far away too. The diversity of the community is amazing and I love the peace - it’s quite a quiet street.""

What the agent says:

Enjoy The Best Of Ealing On Your Own Terms. This first-floor flat is close to the action when you want to hit the shops, grab something to eat or enjoy plentiful green space. But it's also the perfect place to just kick back & enjoy a quiet night in.

This light & bright, larger than average flat, is in a period conversion in a 'just right' Ealing location. It's close enough to the buzz of the Broadway but far enough away so you can enjoy some peace and quiet.

Located on a quiet and leafy residential street, you're just a 9-minute walk from the new Elizabeth Line at West Ealing.

There's so much to enjoy on your doorstep in West Ealing and Ealing Broadway but you can hop onto the tube which will get you to the heart of London in around 20 minutes.

If you love outdoor green space, Walpole Park is literally one road away! 

You’re spoiled for choice with both Walpole Park & Lammas Park close by and Gunnersbury Park less around a 25 minute walk away.

The flat itself has been thoughtfully and tastefully refurbished and is turnkey ready for the next lucky owner.

As you’d expect with a Victorian property, it's full of character and the high ceilings give each room a feeling of openness and space.

The window at the front is a particularly nice feature, flooding the reception room with light and giving a pleasant view of the street below.

The home benefits from the use of a stunning West facing communal garden which is perfect for those summer evenings.

This flat could be perfect if you're looking for a first-time buy or a solid investment property, that comes with an abundance of period charm, rather than a soulless modern apartment.

It's in great condition and in a convenient location that gives you the best of both worlds.",EPC rating: C*,"['Tenure:\xa0', 'Share of freehold', 'Ground rent:\xa0', '£0 per annum  |  review period: unconfirmed', 'Service charge:\xa0', '£200 per annum', 'Council tax:\xa0', 'Band C', 'Broadband:\xa0', 'Ultra-fast 1000Mbps *', 'Mobile signal:\xa0', 'EE ', 'O2 ', 'Three ', 'Vodafone ']"

It has come to our attention that computer hackers are seeking to target property transactions to access funds. As we understand it, they will either hack a phone, tablet, or PC, maybe by sending out a random email that mistakenly gets opened, or even whilst opening a website, which gives them access to that machine. The reason for us mentioning this to you is to alert you that once they have gained access, they can monitor email correspondence, without you knowing, throughout a transaction. Then, at a relevant point, e.g., just before the exchange of contracts, they can send an email to a client mirroring that of their solicitor asking for funds to be transferred to a certain bank account. That money then, of course, disappears. Fortunately, we have not had such an instance but, feel it important to highlight the fact that if you do receive an email requesting funds, it is worth checking with the person concerned by phone that it is genuine and the bank details are correct, before sending money. This could, of course, affect other areas of finance beyond the property. Solicitors are starting to highlight this point now, but for safety, we would urge you to be vigilant and check before sending money or passing on any personal details regarding any bank or credit card information.The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991These particulars are set out as a general outline in accordance with the Property Misdescriptions Act (1991) only for the guidance of intending purchasers or lessees and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract.

Impressive properties on substantial plots line the wide, tree-lined road which is situated between Wanstead High Street to the North, including Wanstead's Central Line Tube Station at the northerly end of The Green, and the iconic Grade I listed Georgian church of St. Mary's to the South. Green space is all encompassing in this conservation area, with Wanstead's Cricket, Tennis, Bowling and Golf Clubs all adjacent to the property (with grounds visible from the first floor).  Additionally, Wanstead Park, a former hunting ground of Henry VII, offers ornamental lakes and grounds for scenic walks.  The commencement of Epping Forest (at the end of Overton Drive) is only 0.3 miles away, also providing extensive walking opportunities and significant bridleway access.""Wyndlawn"", built in 1926, marks the beginning of St. Mary's Avenue and comprises a large detached home of approximately 2,371 square feet.  By virtue of its positioning, this large corner plot comprises one of the most significant sized plots on St. Mary's Avenue, providing a substantial South / Easterly garden which is very private and not overlooked at all on one side; one of the many rare attributes of this home. Another rare attribute comprises the private equestrian facility (possibly the only private home in the area with stables), together with a separate double garage with studio and bathroom on the first floor, with an attached shed to one side of the garages. A deep, smart frontage bordered by intricate wrought iron railings provides a perfect entrance to the home and leads into a furnished entrance hall, where an attractive original central staircase dominates the space.  A well-proportioned formal sitting room leads to a large dining room, both benefiting from impressive views across the immaculate gardens, with natural light enabled by an extensive run of windows on the majority of walls.  The large retro kitchen / diner can be accessed directly via the formal dining room or the central entrance hall and is again spacious and bright with a separate pantry.  A convenient downstairs bathroom and a cellar are also accessible from the ground floor.To the first floor, a substantial landing area leads to five bedrooms and a family bathroom, of which the principal bedroom enjoys Chippendale-fitted furniture with a good deal of surrounding floor space and dual aspect windows.  There are two further good-sized doubles which also include views of St. Mary's Church and Wanstead Golf Course, and one providing access to good-sized eaves storage; another bedroom is currently used as a combination of dressing room and single bedroom and there is a further smaller study / potential single bedroom.  The retro family bathroom comfortably accommodates a bathroom suite and separate shower, with natural light flooding in from a combination of windows and glass block tiles.  The loft provides ample storage space or opportunity to expand the already generous living accommodation (STPC).Externally, the extremely private South / Easterly garden begins with a wraparound patio accessed from both formal reception rooms and kitchen and includes a raised veranda area which is accessible directly from the dining room; the perfect place to relax, dine and entertain al fresco.  The manicured lawn, bordered by established shrubs and trees, leads to a pair of stables (constructed by Scotts of Thrapston) positioned to the rear of the plot, with a detached double garage, electric garage doors accessible from Overton Drive and hard-standing providing plenty of room for secure parking.  To the rear of the double garage, stairs lead to a first floor studio with a small bathroom (including sits-bath, WC and sink), a potential kitchenette area and eaves storage, providing usage as an annexe or outside office area with facilities.  A brick-built storage shed, a composting facility and an additional large storage room attached to the double garage are also incorporated into this rear area allowing for facilities to be available without being in sight of the house or garden – this area lends itself well to development subject to the usual planning consents.

Dating back to c.1880, during the expansion of the railways in the days of Queen Victoria, the property was owned by the railways until 1967 when it was sold as a result of the 'Beeching Cuts'. It now affords an entrance porch, a central hallway, reception room/bedroom 2 with log-burning stove, a spacious open plan kitchen/living/dining room with floor to ceiling windows looking onto the gardens, a double bedroom with feature fireplace, a bathroom/wc with both bath and shower enclosure and benefits from gas heating.  Not listed, the bungalow is perfect as it is, however there is possible scope to extend, outwards or upwards (subject to the usual consents).The grounds are 0.21 acres (0.084 hectares) and may provide some additional potential for those with a specific requirement for lots of parking, storage or running a business from home. There may be a possibility for re-development however the sellers may wish to include a development clause in the sales contract.Call the seller's sole agent, Martin & Co Croydon, now for an appointment to view!          ",EPC rating: F*,"['Tenure:\xa0', 'Council tax:\xa0', 'Broadband:\xa0', 'Super-fast 70Mbps *', 'Mobile signal:\xa0', 'EE ', 'O2 ', 'Three ', 'Vodafone ']"

This charming and beautifully presented Grade ll listed Georgian property, built early in the 18th century, sits in a coveted location occupying a large corner plot, adjacent to the River Thames, with its original walled garden and offering a separate garage and off street parking. Langham Cottage is a fine example of an exquisite, detached, double fronted Georgian cottage, presenting in effect a riverside country retreat, yet only half an hour from Waterloo Station.   The house is approached from Sion Row, through an entrance gate into a secluded walled front garden. A York stone path leads to the patios and front door, with ornate wooden architrave and triangular pediment above, opening to the entrance hall and thus leading to the beautifully configured living space and accommodation. Extensive restoration works, designed by leading Georgian architect Donald Insall Associates, were undertaken in 2015/16 by the current owners and have further enhanced the charm of this beautiful house. Many period features were left in place, while the house has been brought most  sympathetically into the 21st Century, as a comfortable and secluded home.  This extraordinary property in brief comprises; on the ground floor: entrance porch, two reception rooms, study, kitchen by de Vol, larder, a wine cellar, utility area, downstairs WC and boot hallway; on the first and second floors: four bedrooms, two bathrooms, all finished to a very high standard. The property further benefits from an enchanting, meticulously landscaped and lovingly maintained south facing garden, providing privacy and tranquillity. It is planted with a copious selection of plants and trees, including a protected magnolia, fig, banana and cherry trees, a vine and many others, all serviced by a built-in watering system. Uniquely positioned looking over the river, Langham Cottage backs onto the stunning York House Gardens, with local tennis and Twickenham Yacht Club within a stone’s throw of the property.  Langham Cottage is within minutes of the open spaces of Marble Hill House and Park, Orleans House Gallery and Gardens and lies just across the river from Ham House via Hammertons Ferry. The property sits within one of the rarest and most coveted of locations in South West London – perfect for walks in the historic Arcadian environs from Richmond Palace to Hampton Court. The splendour of Royal Richmond Park is half an hours walk away along the river, across historic Richmond Bridge, passing many independent coffee shops.The house is within close proximity of Twickenham town centre, including Waterstones, Gails and a large Waitrose , whilst being within reach of many of the area’s superb retail attractions such as the pedestrianised Church Street, where you will find a varied collection of pubs, restaurants, cafes and artisan shops.  Local transport links include: numerous bus routes to surrounding areas, plus frequent fast trains to Central London via South West Trains from Twickenham station (Waterloo 20 minutes) which is within easy walking distance from Langham Cottage. Numerous buses at the end of Sion Road run to Richmond station overground (Waterloo 16 minutes) and London Underground’s District Line. The property is well placed for access to the A316/M3, M4 and M25 motorways and Heathrow Airport, which can be reached easily by road, train or bus.

Constructed circa 1860, the apartment was extensively remodelled and restored by the current owners in collaboration with Robinson van Noort architects. They sought to preserve the existing fabric of the building, with all its period details in place, while updating it for modern family life. Unfolding over 1,350 sq ft, the apartment has three bedrooms and a generous open plan living, kitchen and dining area, as well as wonderfully high ceilings throughout. A balcony sits to the rear, with pretty green views over the back of the terrace and neighbouring gardens.

Setting the Scene

Previously owned by a painter, the apartment enjoys exceptional light from both its south and north sides. Robinson van Noort's brief was to create a space suitable for a young family, with a third bedroom that could be used as a study or family snug, while maintaining the apartment’s openness and wonderful quality of natural light. The architects successfully did this by fitting a set of 19th-century glazed doors to separate this area so that it could open to the rest of the apartment or be closed off to create a more private space. The rest of the apartment has been planned in the same way, cleverly capitalising on light and volume while ensuring that modern amenities, like additional storage and a luxurious en suite bathroom in the principal bedroom, are still abundant.

The Belsize Conservation Area is defined by mid-19th century Italianate villas such as this one. It was given conservation area status by the Borough of Camden in 1979, due to the fact that the semi-detached Victorian villas ""show elaborate and consistent architectural detail and within the designated boundary there is little to detract from the unity of appearance. Belsize Village is also an area of considerable charm, the particular character of the village being one of the main justifications for designation"".  For more information, please see the History section below.

The Grand Tour

Communal areas lined with William Morris wallpaper lead to this apartment's front door, which is on the first floor. This opens straight into a wide hallway. To the rear of the plan is a voluminous and airy open plan living space, with exceptionally high ceilings. This south-facing room is bathed in glorious light, which enters through tall sash windows throughout the day. The space has been carefully updated: the room's handsome original marble fireplace was retained, while new engineered oak floorboards have been installed underfoot. The kitchen, tucked around the corner, has a window above the sink, framing lovely views over gardens. Here, dark blue painted cabinetry is set against marble worktops. There is a brilliant freestanding island in the middle of the kitchen; with the addition of chairs, this would make a lovely breakfast area.

The apartment has a brilliant flow, with two doors leading out of this open plan area into the corridor. Here, a set of 19th-century glazed doors open to the study. The wonderfully flexible room has been used in previous years as a guest bedroom, and would make a cosy snug for winter evenings.

Two bedrooms are located at the front of the apartment; the principal bedroom has a luxurious en suite bathroom, tucked behind an internal window. The en suite's stone sink has been fitted with two ceramic basins, with a shower is around the corner. The second bedroom shares the rest of the apartment's wonderfully high ceilings and has a floor-to-ceiling sash window. There is also a separate shared bathroom, complete with a freestanding yellow-painted bathtub.

The apartment is filled with clever storage solutions, including a coat cupboard tucked next to the front door. A loft, the perfect spot for storing suitcases, has been created above part of the hallway. There is also a separate dressing room, which services the principal bedroom.

The Great Outdoors 

A curved balcony sits on the south side of the building and enjoys the afternoon and evening sun, making this a perfect spot for watching the sunset over nearby rooftops. With charming views and wisteria climbing up the rear façade of the house, the terrace is surrounded by greenery. This is a quiet and peaceful perch from which to enjoy an evening drink.

Out and About 

Belsize Park Gardens is in a fantastic position, just a short walk from the shops, restaurants and pubs of Belsize Village, Swiss Cottage, Haverstock Hill and England's Lane. Hampstead Theatre, a gym, a spa and two cinemas, including an Everyman, are all in walking distance, as is a Waitrose on Finchley Road. To the north, Hampstead Village and the vast open spaces of Hampstead Heath are easily accessible. Many of London’s best independent schools are walking distance from the apartment, including The Hall, St Antony’s, South Hampstead High School, St Christopher’s, Trevor Roberts and Sarum Hall.

Three nearby underground stations are minutes from the house: Swiss Cottage (Jubilee line) Belsize Park (Northern line) and Finchley Road (Jubilee and Metropolitan lines).

This versatile end terrace could be the perfect first step onto the housing ladder. 

It’s just been refurbished to a really great standard and is so close to the Broadway shops, bars and eateries that it could actually improve your social life, rather than cramping your style!

When you step into the hall you’ll get a sense of the light and space on offer - which the crisp neutral colour scheme helps to accentuate.

It has a traditional ground floor layout, with a bay fronted lounge and a separate dining room which leads to a modern fitted kitchen.

It really is a blank canvas ready for you to add your own personality and style, with just enough ‘old’ to add a touch of traditional class to the modern refurb.

Upstairs has two double bedrooms, a single bedroom and a stylish and new family bathroom.

Being an end terrace on a corner plot means you get more outside space than most. You can get round the side to the low maintenance west facing back garden and it comes with a detached double garage.

The secluded and private courtyard garden is a peaceful spot to sit out and enjoy the sun in the afternoon and evening.

If you’ve got a car (or two) you can park them in the detached double garage at the end of the garden. Or if you’re like the 53% of British car owners who never park their car in the garage, it could be converted into a garden office, a studio or bar!

You’d need to check out if you needed planning for this, just as you’d need to seek planning permission if you wanted to convert the loft into another bedroom. There’s certainly the scope to do so…and many neighbours have already done it to gain some extra space.

But all this talk of home improvement projects gets away from one of the best things about this property! It’s a move-in-ready home that’s only a stones throw from the bustling Broadway.

It only takes a minute's walk up to the Broadway and less than 15 minutes to West Ealing station. That means you can hop onto a new Elizabeth Line train which will get you to Paddington in under 15 minutes.

If you’ve got too much going on in your busy lives to get involved in DIY you’ll also appreciate this being a chain free and turnkey ready property. 

It’s in fantastic condition and the quiet-but-ever-so-convenient location gives you the best of both worlds.

The rear of this charming Edwardian 4-bedroom semi has been transformed into a beautiful open-plan kitchen/diner with a raised terrace and a sun trap back garden, ideal for entertaining.

Take a stroll down leafy Wimborne Gardens and this immaculate semi really doesn’t stand out from any of its near neighbours. The classic mock-Tudor design and well-maintained front garden fits in perfectly on this sought-after street.

But when you step inside you’ll immediately see the transformation that's taken place, with meticulous attention to detail and a superb quality finish throughout.

Gorgeous parquet flooring runs throughout the ground floor, from the spacious bay-fronted lounge to the impressive kitchen/diner at the rear.

It’s one of the finest examples of an open plan social space we’ve seen, making full use of the fantastic rear and side extension.

The kitchen is impressive, with shaker style fitted units and a substantial island unit as the centrepiece and focal point of the room.

But it’s the small details that make such a big difference; from the exposed brickwork, to the roof lantern which floods the room with light and full width bi-fold doors which lead out to the terrace.

On that note, you can tell that just as much thought has been given to the outside as the superb interior. 

When the sun’s out and the bi-fold doors have been opened, the raised terrace will really come into its own, creating a seamless space that’s perfect for entertaining.

The west facing garden gets the sun in the late afternoon and evening, so you can chase the last rays of sunshine by heading down to the lower level which has another seating area and a 4G artificial lawn.

The first floor has two double bedrooms and two good size single bedrooms, along with a luxurious family bathroom.

With almost 1600m2 of accommodation there’s plenty of room for a growing family. If you do need more space there’s an opportunity to convert the loft into two further bedrooms and a bathroom (subject to planning permission, of course).

The property is practical too, with a handy utility room just off the kitchen and a downstairs shower room that should make things easier when everyone is rushing to get out to school and work in the morning. 

On the subject of schools, there’s a fantastic choice of local schools nearby.

North Ealing Primary (rated ‘Good’ by Ofsted) & Drayton Green Primary School (rated ‘Good’ by Ofsted) are around 15 minutes walk away. 

For older kids, Drayton Manor High School (an ‘Outstanding’ secondary school) is only 20 minutes walk or a 6-minute bike ride away.

If you prefer independent schools, there’s a great selection of both single-sex and co-ed schools nearby. St Benedicts, Durston House and Montpelier are all nearby, with Notting Hill & Ealing High School literally at the end of the street.

Wimborne Gardens is also conveniently located between West Ealing and Ealing Broadway stations, they’re both around 15 minutes walk away.

You can hop onto a new Elizabeth Line train which will get you to Paddington in less than 20 minutes.

Or you could stay closer to home to browse the big name retailers and restaurants on the Broadway.

If you prefer your shops and cafés to be smaller and locally owned, Pitshanger Lane is only 10 minutes walk away.

Keep walking for another couple of minutes and you’ll reach Pitshanger Park - perfect for a park run, a picnic or just walking the dog. You can grab a coffee and stroll back via Cleveland Park, which is only a couple of streets away.

This superb Edwardian family home is in a lovely leafy location, is in immaculate condition and has one of the most impressive rear extensions we’ve seen. It works so well with the fabulous back garden to create a sociable space that’s perfect for entertaining friends and family.

Both of these rooms are bright from their Velux windows and benefit from eves storage. There is also a large landing (shown on the floor plan as 'Reception Room 3'). This space is flexible and would make an excellent office space, cozy snug or TV/Gaming area depending on your requirements.Externally the property benefits from a block paved driveway with off street parking for 1 - 2 cars, secured by black metal electric security gates. Further convenance is afforded by side access to the East facing garden.The location of the property couldn't be better if you want to live in central South Woodford as everything is on your door step.

There’s also a cloakroom with a part-glazed original door, frosted sash, close-coupled loo and wall-hung basin with traditional chrome taps.The characterful original stripped timber door to your left – one of several in the property – leads to the fabulous dual-aspect living and dining room. Lit by a wide bay with new bespoke plantation shutters and radiator beneath, the walls to the front have been painted in Farrow & Ball’s French Grey, while the dining area to the rear has been painted in Calamine and has a sash overlooking the garden. There’s a storage cupboard here too with a timber door.Both windows have radiators beneath, and there are roses on the ceilings, while newly fitted bespoke floor-to-ceiling storage and a matching TV cabinet bridge the two spaces. However, the focal point is the elegant original cast-iron fireplace with marble surround, mosaic hearth and fantastic swan-design tiles.Walk through to the kitchen, which feels light and airy thanks to the glazed rear door and a lovely side-facing bay. The current owners tell us it’s the perfect spot to sit with a morning coffee as the early sun hits the garden.The floorboards here have been painted a dusky blue-grey, complementing dark blue kitchen units with chrome cup handles and pulls, while the white worktop pairs with elongated glazed tiles in a herringbone pattern to the splashback.Open timber shelving runs along the wall, and there’s a pendant fitting over the dining area, with a radiator in the bay. The one-and-a-half bowl steel sink and drainer has a traditional-style chrome mixer tap, but you’ll also find a five-ring freestanding gas range and dishwasher, and space for a fridge-freezer.Returning to the hallway, take the stairs with exposed treads, white painted spindles, and polished bannister rail to the first floor.The primary bedroom lies at the rear of the house and is flooded with light from both a side bay window with bespoke Venetian blinds and a rear sash, both enjoying garden views. The floorboards have been lovingly sanded and restored, while the walls are painted in Dimity by Farrow & Ball.The footprint allows for a dressing area with a beautiful original cast-iron fireplace featuring a white painted timber surround and patterned tiled hearth. It then steps down to a cosy bedroom space with a vaulted sloped ceiling, radiator and Pooky antique brass wall lights. You’ll find the second double bedroom – which could make an alternative primary – at the front of the house, lit by a bay window with a radiator beneath and overlooking leafy Coronation Gardens. Floorboards run underfoot here too, while the Wedgewood blue colour-blocked walls reference the cobalt blue glazed tiled hearth of the original cast-iron feature fireplace. In the alcoves, tongue-and-groove panelling backs the attractive inbuilt shelving, while the high ceiling is finished with a rose and pendant fitting. Adjacent, bedroom three is a lovely single currently used as a study, but it would also work well as a nursery. With wooden floorboards, a radiator, and a pendant light, the walls have been drenched in a wonderful forest green shade, reflecting the trees in the park seen through the front-facing sash. The family bathroom lies beside the primary bedroom, with a part-frosted window overlooking the garden. The walls are fully tiled in white, with white mosaic tiles to the floor and blue-grey mosaics to the bath panels. There’s a bath with a shower and chrome mixer tap, a close-coupled loo with a timber seat, and a pedestal sink with taps to match the bath. Other details include a tall chrome towel rail and two storage cabinets.Back on the carpeted landing, a second staircase leads to the loft, where the white-painted fourth double bedroom feels calm and private, with two timber-framed Velux windows, a radiator, and useful inbuilt eaves storage on both sides.Outside, timber fencing encloses the 58ft garden. The side return and patio (with a handy brick-built storage shed – where you’ll find plumbing for a washing machine) lead to a lawn edged with bamboo, Choisya, lavender and various grasses. Meanwhile, to the rear, you’ll discover a stepped section with sleeper-edged beds and a smaller seating area in the shade of a mature walnut tree.A NOTE FROM THE OWNERS:‘There is something indefinable about this house that immediately feels special and like home. We’ve loved its quirky character, from the downstairs layout to the beautiful tiled living room fireplace and the unique master bedroom. It’s bright and airy in the summer, yet with perfect cosy corners for the winter, and it’s so rare to find somewhere with a hallway that really feels like an entrance rather than a corridor connecting the rooms. It’s lovely arriving home, opening the door and seeing straight through to the garden.’ IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD:Buckingham Road is just seven minutes’ walk from Leyton Tube on the Central line,while you can reach the Overground at Leyton Midland Road in just under 15 minutes. For journeys further afield, Stratford International and Walthamstow Central are within easy reach.Just a couple of streets away, Francis Road offers a wonderful collection of delis, coffee spots, and independent shops. Try Yardarm for wine, deli goods and small plates; Marmelo for fantastic bread and delicious dining; Pause for yoga and Pilates; and Phlox for books and a relaxing coffee.There’s a vibrant local community with several excellent pubs, including the Coach & Horses (for roasts and a sunny beer garden), Leyton Technical, Heathcote & Star, Filly Brook and Gravity Well Brewing. Also worth a visit is Patchworks on Church Road – an all-in-one café, bar, pop-up restaurant and art gallery.The current owners recommend the tasty toasties and coffee from Deeney’s, Sunday morning pastries from Morny’s bakery, pizza at Figo, Singburi for delicious Thai food and Mora for proper authentic Italian fare.The V&A East Museum and Storeroom are set to open in 2025 and will be around a 20-minute walk away. In the meantime, there’s always Abba Voyage within walking distance to keep you entertained or Host of Leyton, just up the road, with different weekly pop-ups.Right on your doorstep, Coronation Gardens is a lovely place to stroll, run, have a picnic or explore the maze, while Sidmouth Park is great for kids.

Built in 1771 by the East India Company by the celebrated architect Richard Jupp, the building was used to store exotic imports such as spices, teas, silks and cotton from Asia. The Tapestry building was designed for functionality and practicality and yet it possesses immense character and majesty due to it scale and symmetry.  It is by far one of the most beautiful pieces of Georgian architecture found in The City of London, retaining neat Georgian brickwork, beamed ceilings and panelling and it remains as impressive today as it was over two hundred years ago.  With an unrivalled specification the apartment includes comfort cooling, intelligent lighting & entertainment system, Gaggenau kitchen appliances and bespoke joinery throughout.   The accommodation is extremely generous with the integrity of the warehouse’s industrial past retained whenever possible. There is a vast triple aspect reception room with wonderfully high ceilings, seven windows and sympathetically restored ceiling beams. This wonderful entertaining space has been intelligently arranged with living dining and study areas within this immense space whilst leading onto a semi open plan bespoke kitchen and utility room. The principal bedroom has a walk-in wardrobe and opulent ensuite bathroom with a further guest suite with its own bathroom. The apartment offers generous storage as well as a guest cloakroom.   The location offers excellent transport links with Liverpool Street Underground (Central, Circle, Hammersmith and City, Metropolitan and Elizabeth Lines) and rail station moments away, with Spitalfields Market, The City and numerous excellent shops including the recently open Eataly moments away.
